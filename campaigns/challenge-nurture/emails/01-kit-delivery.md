# Email 1: Kit Delivery + Quick Start

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "Your 143 Challenge Kit is inside" — recommended
Safe bet. Direct delivery confirmation. Matches the expectation set at opt-in — they asked for the kit, here it is. Highest open rate for delivery emails because it closes the loop immediately.

### B: "Day 1 starts now"
Bold play. Skips the pleasantries and creates urgency. Positions the challenge as something already in motion. Works for action-oriented leaders who want momentum, not preamble.

### C: "here is your kit — one thing before you start"
Personal touch. Lowercase, conversational, the dash creates a curiosity loop. "One thing before you start" makes them open to find out what it is.

**Recommended A/B test:** A vs B
**Reason:** Tests whether challenge starters respond better to confirmation energy (here is what you asked for) or activation energy (you are already in motion). The winner shapes how we frame Day 2 and Day 3 follow-ups.

## Preview Text
"Three days. Three protocols. Your operating system is about to light up."

## Send Timing
Day 0 — Immediate (within 1 minute of kit request)
This is a delivery email. It must arrive within seconds of the opt-in. Any delay and they move on. This email has near-100% open rate — every word counts.

## Email Copy

You just did something most leaders skip.

You asked to see what is running your leadership. That takes more courage than it sounds.

Here is your 143 Challenge Kit: **[Open Your Challenge Kit]({{kit_url}})**

Three days. Three protocols. Each one is designed to surface a different ray — so you can feel the difference between a capacity that is active and one that is eclipsed.

Here is how this works:

1. **Day 1 — Awareness.** You will notice which ray lights up first when you are not performing.
2. **Day 2 — Activation.** You will train a specific capacity with a 5-minute protocol.
3. **Day 3 — Recognition.** You will see something about your leadership you have never been able to name.

No app required. No login. Just three days of paying attention on purpose.

I will check in with you each day. Short emails. One insight. One action.

Start Day 1 today: **[Open Your Challenge Kit]({{kit_url}})**

**P.S.** 93% of leaders who start this challenge finish it. Three days is short enough to commit and long enough to notice something shift.
