# Email 3: Day 2 Activation Protocol

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "Day 2 — time to train"
Safe bet. Sequential framing — they know they are on Day 2, this confirms it. "Time to train" is action-forward without being demanding. Clean, clear, high open rate for mid-sequence emails.

### B: "Yesterday you noticed. Today you activate." — recommended
Bold play. Two sentences that mirror the challenge arc: Awareness → Activation. Declarative — tells them what is happening in their development. Creates continuity from Day 1 check-in. The period between sentences adds weight.

### C: "5 minutes that change how you lead today"
Personal touch. Specific time commitment (5 minutes) reduces friction. "Change how you lead today" is immediate — not someday, today. Appeals to leaders who need ROI on their time.

**Recommended A/B test:** B vs C
**Reason:** Tests whether narrative continuity (building on yesterday) outperforms time-specific benefit framing. The winner reveals how much the audience values story arc vs practical immediacy.

## Preview Text
"One ray showed up yesterday. Now you are going to train it on purpose."

## Send Timing
Day 2 — 8:00 AM ET (morning activation window)
Morning send is deliberate. Day 2 is the action day — they need the protocol before their workday starts. This email should arrive when they are in planning mode, before the day takes over.

## Email Copy

Good morning.

Yesterday was about noticing. Today is about training.

Here is the difference: Awareness shows you which ray is already running. Activation means you choose one and train it — like a rep at the gym, except this one takes five minutes.

Your Day 2 protocol is a single exercise designed to strengthen one specific capacity. Not all nine. Just the one that showed up yesterday.

**[Open Your Day 2 Protocol]({{kit_url}})**

Here is what to expect:

You will feel a slight pull toward doing the exercise "right." That is your performance pattern trying to take over. Ignore it. The protocol works when you stop performing and start paying attention.

Five minutes. One capacity. That is all Day 2 asks.

I will check in tonight with something you will want to see.

— Justin

**P.S.** If yesterday's ray signal was not obvious, that is okay. Do the Day 2 protocol anyway. Sometimes the act of training reveals the ray that awareness missed.
