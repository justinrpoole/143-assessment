# Email 6: Final CTA + Close

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "Your operating system is still running the old pattern"
Safe bet. Extends the OS metaphor with a time-decay framing. Implies that awareness without action means the old patterns win. Creates urgency through truth, not manipulation.

### B: "10 days ago you saw something"
Bold play. Specific time reference ("10 days") anchors them to their challenge experience. "You saw something" is vague enough to trigger recall — they will mentally replay what they noticed. Pattern interrupt because most emails do not reference elapsed time.

### C: "still thinking about it?" — recommended
Personal touch. Lowercase, conversational, direct. Feels like a coach checking in — not a marketer closing. No pressure, just an honest question. High open rate because it reads like a personal message, not a campaign email.

**Recommended A/B test:** B vs C
**Reason:** Tests whether temporal anchoring ("10 days ago") outperforms casual directness ("still thinking about it?"). The winner reveals whether the audience needs to be reminded of their experience or just given permission to act.

## Preview Text
"The challenge showed you something. The assessment shows you everything."

## Send Timing
Day 10 — Tuesday or Thursday at 9:00 AM ET
Ten days from the challenge start. This is the last email in the sequence — the final conversion window before they move to newsletter-only. Morning send on a business day catches them in decision mode.

## Email Copy

Ten days ago, you started the 143 Challenge.

You spent three days noticing which capacities are running your leadership. You felt rays light up. You may have felt one go quiet.

That was real. And it is still true today.

Here is what I have seen with hundreds of leaders: the ones who stop at awareness eventually forget what they noticed. Not because it was not real — but because the daily noise covers it back up.

The ones who go further — who map all nine rays and see their full Light Signature — do not forget. Because once you have a map, you cannot unsee the terrain.

The full Be The Light Assessment takes 15 minutes.

When you are done, you will see:

- All 9 rays scored — not the 2 or 3 you felt during the challenge, but every capacity measured
- 36 subfacets mapped — the specific behaviors underneath each ray
- Your eclipse pattern — which capacities got covered up, and why
- Your Light Signature Map — the complete picture of how your operating system is actually running

**[Map My Full Light Signature — $43]({{assessment_url}})**

One payment. No subscription. Your map is yours forever.

If now is not the right time, I understand. You will still get a weekly email from me — one leadership insight, no selling.

But if you are still thinking about what you saw during those three days, this is the next step.

**P.S.** $43 for 143 questions. 15 minutes. 36 Light Signatures. That is less than most leaders spend on a single business lunch — and this one shows you what is actually running your leadership.
