# Email 5: Bridge to Full Assessment

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "You felt 3 rays. There are 9." — recommended
Safe bet. Specific numbers create an instant gap. They experienced 3 — but the full picture is 9. Mathematical curiosity that makes the assessment feel like an obvious next step. Clean, direct, no hype.

### B: "What the Challenge could not show you"
Bold play. Frames the challenge as incomplete — not bad, but limited by design. Creates a "what am I missing?" tension. Works because they trust Justin after 3 days of value, so the claim feels honest, not salesy.

### C: "the part most leaders miss"
Personal touch. Lowercase, insider knowledge framing. "Most leaders" creates social comparison without shame. "Miss" implies something hidden in plain sight — which is exactly what eclipses are.

**Recommended A/B test:** A vs C
**Reason:** Tests whether specific quantification ("3 rays... 9") outperforms social framing ("most leaders miss"). The winner tells us whether the audience converts on data or on belonging.

## Preview Text
"Your 3-day challenge revealed a fraction. The full assessment maps everything."

## Send Timing
Day 5 — Tuesday or Thursday at 9:00 AM ET
Two days after the challenge ends. This gap is intentional — gives them time to sit with what they experienced before bridging to the next step. Morning send catches them in decision-making mode, not wind-down mode.

## Email Copy

You just spent three days paying attention to your leadership operating system.

Here is what you saw: one or two rays that showed up. Maybe a capacity that felt easy to access. Maybe one that felt distant or covered.

That is real. That matters.

But here is what the Challenge was designed to do — and what it was not designed to do:

**What it showed you:** Which rays are loudest. Which ones show up first when you stop performing. The difference between a capacity that is running and one that is quiet.

**What it could not show you:** All nine rays measured precisely. The 36 subfacets underneath them. Which capacities are eclipsed — not weak, but actively covered by a pattern you cannot see from the inside.

That is what the full Be The Light Assessment does.

143 questions. 15 minutes. When you finish, you get your complete Light Signature Map — every ray scored, every eclipse surfaced, every pattern named.

The leaders who go from Challenge to full assessment say the same thing: "I knew something was off. Now I can see exactly what it is."

One-time. No subscription required. Your Light Signature Map is yours forever.

**P.S.** The Challenge gave you awareness. The full assessment gives you precision — 36 specific capacities scored, not just 3 you could feel. That is the difference between knowing something is there and seeing the whole map.
