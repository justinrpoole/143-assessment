# Email 2: Day 1 Check-In + Micro-Joy

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "How did Day 1 land?" — recommended
Safe bet. Direct, personal, assumes they did the work. The word "land" is body-based — it asks about felt experience, not intellectual analysis. High reply rate because it is a genuine question.

### B: "You noticed something today"
Bold play. Declarative — tells them what happened before they articulate it. Creates a "how did they know?" moment. Works because most people DO notice something on Day 1, even if they cannot name it yet.

### C: "quick check-in from your coach"
Personal touch. Lowercase, positions Justin as their coach (not a marketer). "Quick" reduces friction. The word "coach" reframes the entire email relationship.

**Recommended A/B test:** A vs B
**Reason:** Tests whether check-in energy (asking) outperforms declaration energy (telling them what they experienced). The winner reveals how directive vs collaborative the remaining emails should feel.

## Send Timing
Day 1 — 6:00 PM ET (evening reflection window)
Evening send is deliberate. They did the Day 1 protocol earlier. This email lands when they are winding down — the moment reflection happens naturally. B2B leaders check personal-development email in the evening, not during work hours.

## Email Copy

Day 1 is done.

Something happened during Day 1.

For some leaders, it is obvious — a moment where one ray felt more accessible than the others. A flash of clarity that came without effort.

For others, it is quiet. That is fine. Awareness is not always loud. Sometimes it is a slight shift in what you pay attention to.

Here is what I want you to try tonight — a 2-minute micro-joy practice:

Think of one moment today where you felt genuinely light. Not productive. Not successful. Light.

Name it. Say it out loud or write it down. One sentence.

That is a ray signal. Your operating system is telling you which capacity came online today without you forcing it.

Tomorrow is Day 2 — Activation. You will take what you noticed today and train it deliberately. Five minutes. One protocol.

See you in the morning.

**P.S.** If nothing felt different today, do not worry. Some leaders feel it on Day 1. Some feel it on Day 3. The protocol works either way — you just have to keep showing up.
