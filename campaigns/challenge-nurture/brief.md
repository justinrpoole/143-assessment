# Campaign: Challenge Nurture

## Goal
Convert 143 Challenge starters into full Be The Light Assessment purchasers within 10 days. Target: 12%+ click-through on $43 assessment CTA by Email 6.

## Sequence Type
Nurture

## Emails
6 emails over 10 days

## Angle
"You just felt three rays light up. The full assessment reveals all nine — and the ones that got covered up along the way."

## Audience Segment
Contacts who requested the 143 Challenge Kit via email capture on /143. Awareness level: Solution-aware (they know about the OS metaphor and rays from the welcome series or capture page) but not yet Product-aware (they have not experienced the full assessment or seen their Light Signature Map).

## Lead Magnet
143 Challenge — free 3-day leadership light challenge with daily protocols. Already delivered in Email 1 of this sequence.

## Paid Offer
$43 one-time Be The Light Assessment (143 questions, 15 minutes, 36 Light Signatures). Bridge to $14.33/mo Coaching OS subscription.

## Bridge Logic
Challenge Kit delivery → Daily protocol support → Show what 3 days revealed → Reveal what the full assessment adds (36 subfacets, eclipse mapping, coaching brief) → CTA to purchase assessment.

## Timeline
Day 0 through Day 10

## ESP
Omnisend (marketing automation) — triggered on tag `143_challenge` added to contact.

## Status

## Voice Notes
Supportive coach energy. They already took action by requesting the kit — honor that. Each email should feel like a coach checking in during a program. Progress-focused, not sales-focused. The $43 CTA only appears starting Email 5. Emails 1-4 are pure value and encouragement.
