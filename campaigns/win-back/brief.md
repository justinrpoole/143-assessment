# Campaign: Win-Back

## Goal
Re-engage churned Coaching OS subscribers ($14.33/mo) who have been inactive for 60+ days. Primary metric: reactivation rate. Secondary: portal return visits (even without resubscribing).

## Sequence Type
Re-engagement

## Emails
1 email at Day 60 of inactivity

## Angle
"Your map did not expire. Your light did not go out." The eclipse metaphor works here — their practice went dark the same way a ray goes dark. Not because the capacity disappeared, but because something covered it. The email reframes their absence as a pattern, not a failure, and positions reactivation as uncovering what was always there.

## Audience Segment
Former Coaching OS subscribers who:
- Completed the full Be The Light Assessment ($43)
- Subscribed to the Coaching OS ($14.33/mo)
- Used at least some daily practices (morning intention, reps, etc.)
- Canceled or lapsed 60+ days ago
- Have NOT retaken the assessment or resubscribed

They know the system. They experienced value. Something pulled them away — likely not dissatisfaction, but competing priorities, habit decay, or the belief that they "got what they needed." They are the warmest possible win-back audience because they already bought twice.

## Lead Magnet
N/A — this is a re-engagement trigger, not an opt-in.

## Paid Offer
Coaching OS reactivation — $14.33/mo (same price, no discount)
- No discount offered. Discounting signals the original price was wrong.
- Value reframe instead: remind them what the system does, show what changed since they left.

## Bridge Logic
They had the MAP and the TRAINING SYSTEM. They stopped training. The map is still there — their Light Signature did not expire. The daily practices are still waiting. The question is not "should I start over?" — it is "should I pick up where I left off?" Reactivation is easier than starting fresh because their data, their streaks (even broken ones), and their ray history are all preserved.

## Timeline
Single send at Day 60 of inactivity

## Email Constraints
- ONE email only. Do not over-pursue churned users.
- No guilt. No "we noticed you left." No passive aggression.
- Honor their autonomy — they chose to pause. Respect that.
- Lead with what is true: their map still exists, their data is preserved, their light is still there.
- Mention one specific thing that has changed or improved since they left (feature, content, insight).
- Tone: coach who runs into a former client at a coffee shop. Warm, genuine, no pitch pressure.

## ESP
Omnisend (triggered automation on 60-day inactivity from `sub_canceled` or `sub_expired` state)

## Voice Notes
This is the most emotionally delicate email in the entire system. These are people who invested real money and real vulnerability — they saw their eclipse pattern, they trained their rays, they built streaks. And then they stopped. The email must honor that investment without weaponizing it. No "you had a 14-day streak and now it is gone" guilt. Instead: "Your map is still here. Your light did not go anywhere. If you want to come back, everything is exactly where you left it."
