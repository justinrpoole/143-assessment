# Email 1: Win-Back

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "Your map is still here" — recommended
Safe bet. Simple, factual, and warm. No guilt, no urgency, no manipulation. States the truth — their map exists and is waiting. "Still here" implies patience, not abandonment. High open rate because it references something personal (their map) without pressure.

### B: "something did not go out"
Bold play. Lowercase, cryptic, pattern interrupt. Creates a curiosity gap — what did not go out? Their light. Their capacity. This subject line works because it is unexpected in an inbox full of "we miss you" re-engagement emails. Risks being too vague for some readers.

### C: "Hey — quick note about your Light Signature"
Personal touch. Feels like a text from someone who knows you. "Quick note" sets a low time commitment. "Your Light Signature" references something deeply personal — their assessment results. No marketing energy, just a person reaching out.

**Recommended A/B test:** A vs C
**Reason:** Tests whether churned subscribers respond more to a truth-based statement about their data ("your map is still here") or a personal, casual tone ("hey — quick note"). The winner reveals whether this segment is motivated by what they left behind or by the relationship with Justin. Critical data for deciding whether future win-back communication should lead with product or coach.

## Preview Text
"Your Light Signature Map did not expire. Neither did your data."

## Send Timing
Day 60 of inactivity — Tuesday or Thursday at 9:00 AM ET
Sixty days is long enough that the absence is real but short enough that the product memory is intact. They still remember what the Coaching OS felt like. Earlier than 60 days risks feeling like surveillance. Later risks them forgetting the experience entirely. Tuesday or Thursday morning catches them in a reflective planning moment — the same window that works for the post-assessment drip. Single send. No follow-up. No sequence. One respectful touch.

## Email Copy

It has been a while since you opened the Coaching OS.

I am not writing to ask why. You had your reasons, and they were yours. Some leaders pause because life got loud. Some pause because the practice felt like one more thing on a list that was already too long. Some pause because they got what they needed and moved on.

All of those are fine.

Here is what I want you to know:

Your Light Signature Map is still there. Every ray, every subfacet, every score — exactly where you left it. Your data was not deleted. Your map was not reset. If you logged a single rep or set a single morning intention, that history is preserved.

The light did not go out. It went dark the way a ray goes dark during an eclipse — not because the capacity disappeared, but because something moved in front of it.

**One thing that changed since you left:**

We added ray-specific protocols to the toolkit. Thirteen of them — one for each ray pattern. If your eclipse was in Ray 4, there is now a targeted protocol designed specifically for training Ray 4. Not generic advice. A specific behavioral sequence matched to your Light Signature Map.

If you want to come back, everything is exactly where you left it.

**[Reactivate My Coaching OS — $14.33/mo]({{subscription_url}})**

Same price. Same system. Your map, your data, your history — all waiting.

You do not have to start over. You just pick up where you stopped.

— Justin

**P.S.** If the timing is not right, that is okay too. Your Light Signature Map is yours forever — it does not expire, and it does not disappear. Whenever you are ready, the door is open.
