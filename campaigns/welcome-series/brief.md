# Campaign: Welcome Series

## Goal
Convert new email subscribers into 143 Challenge starters within 7 days. Target: 25%+ click-through on Challenge CTA by Email 4.

## Sequence Type
Welcome

## Emails
4 emails over 7 days

## Angle
"Your leadership runs on an operating system you never installed. The 143 Challenge is the first diagnostic."

## Audience Segment
New contacts from any capture source — newsletter footer, exit-intent popup, stability check, login form. Awareness level: Problem-aware (they know something is off) but not yet Solution-aware (they don't know about rays, eclipse, or the OS metaphor).

## Lead Magnet
143 Challenge — free 3-day leadership light challenge with daily protocols.

## Paid Offer
$43 one-time Be The Light Assessment (143 questions, 15 minutes, 36 Light Signatures). Bridge to $14.33/mo Coaching OS subscription.

## Bridge Logic
Welcome → Introduce the OS metaphor → Show the science → Demonstrate what assessment reveals → CTA to start free challenge (which then nurtures toward paid assessment).

## Timeline
Day 0 through Day 7

## ESP
Omnisend (marketing automation) — triggered on new contact creation.

## Status
draft

## Voice Notes
Warmest tone in the spectrum. "I see you" energy. One insight per email. Open with felt experience, not product features. Free-first CTA always — never lead with the $43 assessment in this sequence.
