# Email 2: Science + Mechanism

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "Your brain is not broken — it is patterned" — recommended
Safe bet. Immediately reframes the problem as structural, not personal. The dash creates a reveal moment. Validates the reader while opening a curiosity loop about what "patterned" means.

### B: "9 rays. You are only using a few."
Bold play. Specific number creates intrigue. Implies something is missing — but without blame. The period after "9 rays" forces a pause that makes "You are only using a few" land harder.

### C: "the thing no one told you about leadership"
Personal touch. Lowercase, conspiratorial tone. Positions this as insider knowledge. Works for readers who feel overlooked by conventional leadership development.

**Recommended A/B test:** A vs B
**Reason:** Tests whether the audience engages more with a reframe of their experience (A) or a specific, quantified gap (B). The winner tells us how to frame the assessment — as self-understanding or capacity expansion.

## Preview Text
"Neuroscience calls it something specific. Here is why it matters."

## Send Timing
Day 2 — Tuesday or Thursday at 9:00 AM ET
Second email needs to land during a focused morning window. B2B leaders check email between 9-10 AM. Two-day gap from welcome lets the OS metaphor settle without losing momentum.

## Email Copy

Yesterday I told you something is running your leadership.

Today I want to show you what it looks like.

Neuroscience researchers — people like Richard Davidson at Wisconsin and Stephen Porges at Indiana — have mapped specific capacities that drive how leaders show up under pressure.

Not personality types. Not preferences. Capacities.

Things like self-regulation under stress. How quickly you recover from conflict. Whether your default is to protect or to connect. Where your energy flows when nobody is watching.

We organized 12 research pillars into 9 measurable rays. Each ray represents a leadership capacity you can actually train — not just label.

Most leaders are running on 3 or 4 rays. The others are not missing. They are eclipsed — covered by patterns you built to survive, not to lead.

The 143 Challenge is designed to show you which rays light up first.

Three days. Three protocols. You will feel the difference before you see the data.

**P.S.** This is not personality typing. MBTI gives you a label. StrengthsFinder gives you a list. 143 gives you a map — with a training plan attached.
