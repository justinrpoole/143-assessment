# Email 3: Discovery + Value Demonstration

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "What leaders see first when they map their light"
Safe bet. Curiosity-driven — the reader wants to know what "first" means. Positions the assessment as a discovery process, not a test. The word "map" reinforces the OS metaphor.

### B: "The eclipse nobody warned you about" — recommended
Bold play. Pattern interrupt. "Eclipse" introduces the framework's most emotionally resonant concept. "Nobody warned you" creates urgency and insider knowledge tension. Polarizing but memorable.

### C: "I did not expect this result"
Personal touch. First person, past tense — implies Justin took the assessment himself. Creates a "what happened?" curiosity loop. Low-key, honest, non-salesy.

**Recommended A/B test:** B vs C
**Reason:** Tests whether the audience responds to conceptual intrigue (eclipse as metaphor) or personal vulnerability (unexpected result). The winner tells us how to frame the post-assessment experience in the nurture sequence.

Here is what surprises leaders most:

It is not the low scores.

It is the eclipses.

An eclipse is not a weakness. It is a capacity that got covered — by a survival pattern, a coping strategy, or a role you outgrew three years ago but never stopped playing.

One leader I worked with scored high on strategic thinking. Off the charts. But her connection ray was almost completely eclipsed. Not because she could not connect. Because somewhere along the way, she learned that being strategic was safer than being seen.

The assessment did not tell her she was bad at connection. It showed her she had been borrowing energy from strategy to avoid it.

That one insight changed how she led her team in a week. Not a month. A week.

That is what a Light Signature Map reveals. Not who you are. What is running — and what got covered up along the way.

The Challenge is the fastest way to feel which rays are running and which are eclipsed.

**P.S.** 143 questions. 15 minutes. 36 Light Signatures. That is the full assessment. But the 3-day Challenge is where most leaders start — and it is free.
