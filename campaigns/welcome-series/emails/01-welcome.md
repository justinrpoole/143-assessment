# Email 1: Welcome + OS Metaphor

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "Something is running your leadership right now" — recommended
Safe bet. Creates immediate curiosity without clickbait. The word "something" opens a gap the reader needs to close. Aligns with the OS metaphor that anchors the entire sequence.

### B: "You did not install this"
Bold play. Fragment. Pattern interrupt — feels like a warning or a revelation. Polarizing but memorable. Works if the reader is already primed by the capture source.

### C: "hey — welcome (and a question)"
Personal touch. Lowercase, casual, feels like a DM from a friend. The parenthetical creates a secondary curiosity loop. High trust signal for skeptical leaders.

**Recommended A/B test:** A vs B
**Reason:** Tests whether the audience responds better to a full curiosity-driven statement or a punchy fragment. Both use the OS metaphor — the winner tells us how direct we can be in the rest of the sequence.

## Preview Text

I see you.

Not in a woo-woo way. In a "you are carrying something that most leadership advice does not even acknowledge" way.

Here is what I know about you already:

You lead. You perform. You deliver.

And underneath all of that, something is running. A pattern. A default setting. An operating system you never installed — but it is making decisions for you every single day.

How you respond under pressure. Where your energy goes first. What you avoid without realizing you are avoiding it.

That is not a flaw. That is an OS.

And you can see it. Map it. Train it.

That is what 143 Leadership is about. Not fixing you. Showing you what is already running — so you can decide what runs next.

Over the next few days, I will send you one short email at a time. One insight per email. No walls of text. No pitch marathons.

Here is your first move:

Three days. Three protocols. Zero cost. It is the fastest way to see your operating system in action.

**P.S.** 143 is not random. 1 letter, 4 letters, 3 letters. I love you. That is the frequency this work runs on. More on that soon.
