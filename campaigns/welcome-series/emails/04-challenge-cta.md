# Email 4: Direct CTA + Close

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "Your operating system has been running for 7 days without a diagnostic" — recommended
Safe bet. Brings the OS metaphor full circle from Email 1. The specificity of "7 days" creates a time anchor — they have been thinking about this for a week. The word "diagnostic" positions the Challenge as actionable, not theoretical.

### B: "Last email in this series"
Bold play. Metacognitive — breaks the fourth wall. Creates urgency through finality. Honest and non-manipulative. Works because it removes the fear of endless pitching.

### C: "ready when you are"
Personal touch. Lowercase, no pressure, pure permission. Positions the CTA as their choice. High trust signal for skeptical leaders who resist being sold to.

**Recommended A/B test:** A vs C
**Reason:** Tests whether the audience converts better with intellectual framing (OS diagnostic metaphor) or emotional permission (no pressure). The winner shapes CTA voice for the entire funnel going forward.

## Preview Text
"Three days. Three protocols. Zero cost. Start now."

## Send Timing
Day 7 — Tuesday or Thursday at 9:00 AM ET
Final welcome email. Seven days is the maximum window before a new subscriber goes cold. This is the last chance to convert them into a Challenge starter before they move to the newsletter-only segment.

## Email Copy

One week ago, you signed up.

Since then, I have shown you three things:

1. Your leadership runs on an operating system you did not install.
2. That OS is built on 9 measurable capacities — not personality labels.
3. The most important insight is not what is strong. It is what is eclipsed.

Now here is the question:

Are you going to keep reading about it, or are you going to see it?

The 143 Challenge takes three days. One protocol per day. Each one is designed to surface a different ray — so you can feel the difference between a capacity that is running and one that is covered.

No account required to start. No credit card. No pitch at the end.

Just three days of seeing your own operating system in action.

**[Start the 143 Challenge — Free]({{challenge_url}})**

After this, I will send you one email per week — a short leadership insight, no selling. But the Challenge is the thing that makes everything else click.

**P.S.** 93% of leaders who start the Challenge finish it. Three days is short enough to commit and long enough to notice something shift. Start today: {{challenge_url}}
