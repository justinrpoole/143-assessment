# Campaign: Post-Assessment Drip

## Goal
Convert free assessment completers into Coaching OS subscribers ($14.33/mo) by deepening their relationship with their Light Signature Map over 14 days. Secondary goal: drive daily practice adoption so the portal becomes habitual before the subscription pitch.

## Sequence Type
Post-Purchase / Nurture Hybrid

## Emails
4 emails over 14 days

## Angle
"Your map is the beginning, not the end." The assessment gave you precision — now the question is what you do with it. Each email deepens one layer of the map, making the Coaching OS feel like the natural next step rather than an upsell.

## Audience Segment
Leaders who completed the full Be The Light Assessment (143 questions). They invested 15 minutes and $43. They have their Light Signature Map. They know their top rays and eclipse pattern. They are in the highest-intent segment — they already bought once.

## Lead Magnet
N/A — this sequence triggers on assessment completion, not an opt-in.

## Paid Offer
Coaching OS subscription — $14.33/mo
- Daily practice ecosystem (morning intention, energy audit, micro-joy, reps, evening reflection, weekly scan)
- 13 ray-specific protocols in the toolkit
- Growth trajectory tracking across multiple assessments
- Full cosmic report visualization

## Bridge Logic
Assessment gives you the MAP. The Coaching OS gives you the TRAINING SYSTEM. A map without movement is decoration. The daily practices are how the map becomes transformation. $14.33/mo = less than $0.48/day. The number 14.33 is intentional (143 rearranged).

## Timeline
Day 1 through Day 14

## Email Constraints
- Email 1: Celebrate + highlight key insight. NO subscription pitch.
- Email 2: Deepen understanding of top ray. Light mention of daily practices. NO hard subscription pitch.
- Email 3: Introduce daily practice ecosystem. Soft subscription mention.
- Email 4: Direct Coaching OS pitch with full value breakdown.
- Every email must reference their specific assessment experience (use dynamic merge fields where possible).
- Tone: "I see what your map says, and here is what it means." Coach energy, not sales energy.

## ESP
Omnisend (triggered automation on `assessment_completed` event)

## Voice Notes
These emails speak to someone who just had a revealing experience. They saw their eclipse pattern — possibly for the first time. The tone should honor that vulnerability. No "congrats on your purchase!" energy. More "here is what I see in your results, and here is what it means."
