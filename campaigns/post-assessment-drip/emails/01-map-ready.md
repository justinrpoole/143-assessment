# Email 1: Map Ready + Key Insight

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "Your Light Signature Map is ready"
Safe bet. Direct confirmation that their results exist. Matches the expectation set by the assessment experience. Clear, factual, high open rate because they just invested 15 minutes and $43 — they want to see what came back.

### B: "I see what your map says" — recommended
Bold play. Shifts from transactional ("your results are ready") to relational ("I see what your map says"). Implies Justin personally reviewed their results. Creates intimacy and curiosity — what does the map say? What does he see?

### C: "here is what showed up"
Personal touch. Lowercase, casual, feels like a follow-up text from a coach. "Showed up" implies emergence — something surfaced that was already there. Honors the discovery framing rather than the purchase framing.

**Recommended A/B test:** B vs C
**Reason:** Tests whether the audience responds more to coach-authority framing ("I see what your map says") or self-discovery framing ("here is what showed up"). The winner reveals whether they want interpretation or reflection — which shapes all future emails.

## Send Timing
Day 1 — within 2 hours of assessment completion
This email must arrive while the assessment experience is still fresh. They just answered 143 questions about their leadership operating system. Their nervous system is activated — they noticed things about themselves. The email should meet them in that window before the daily noise covers it back up.

## Email Copy

You just did something most leaders never do.

You sat with 143 questions about how your operating system actually runs — not how you wish it ran, not how you present it in meetings. The real version.

Your Light Signature Map is ready. Before you look at it, here is what I want you to know:

What you are about to see is not a grade. It is a photograph of your leadership operating system taken at one moment in time. Some rays will be bright. Some will be eclipsed. Both are information, not verdicts.

**[View My Full Light Signature Map]({{results_url}})**

Here is what I have learned from reading hundreds of these maps:

The part that surprises people is never the strong ray. You already knew which capacities come easy. The part that changes things is the eclipse — the capacity that got covered up by a pattern you could not see from the inside.

That is not damage. That is a ray that learned to hide because, at some point, hiding felt safer than shining.

Sit with your map today. Let it land. Tomorrow I will go deeper into what your top ray actually means — and why it matters more than you think.

— Justin

**P.S.** Your map is yours forever. You can revisit it anytime at {{results_url}}. But today, while it is fresh — look at it once with no agenda. Just notice what you feel.
