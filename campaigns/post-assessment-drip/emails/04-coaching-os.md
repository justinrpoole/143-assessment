# Email 4: Coaching OS Pitch

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "Your map deserves a training system" — recommended
Safe bet. Directly bridges the map (which they have and value) to the training system (what they do not have). "Deserves" implies the map is valuable enough to warrant investment. No hype, no urgency tricks — just a logical next step.

### B: "less than 48 cents a day to train your operating system"
Bold play. Lowercase, leads with the price reframe. $0.48/day collapses the cost objection instantly. "Train your operating system" reinforces the metaphor that has been building across four emails. Specific number creates credibility.

### C: "Two weeks with your map — here is the next level"
Personal touch. Marks the passage of time since assessment (two weeks). "Here is the next level" is conversational and direct. Positions Justin as the coach who has been walking alongside them, now pointing to the next step.

**Recommended A/B test:** A vs B
**Reason:** Tests whether the audience responds more to value framing ("your map deserves a training system") or price reframing ("less than 48 cents a day"). The winner reveals whether this segment is motivated by what they gain or what it costs — critical data for future pricing communication.

## Preview Text
"The assessment showed you what is there. The Coaching OS shows you what is possible."

## Send Timing
Day 14 — Tuesday or Thursday at 9:00 AM ET
Two full weeks since assessment completion. They have received three emails deepening their relationship with their map. Email 3 introduced the daily practice ecosystem — they know what the practices are. Now the question is whether they want the system that makes those practices structured, tracked, and personalized. Morning send on a business day catches them in planning mode.

## Email Copy

Two weeks ago, you saw your Light Signature Map for the first time.

Since then, you have learned what your top ray actually means. You have seen where your eclipse pattern shows up. You may have even tried a morning intention or an energy audit on your own.

Here is what I want to tell you directly:

The assessment gave you the most precise leadership map available. Nine rays. Thirty-six subfacets. Your exact operating system, scored and visible.

But a map without a training system is decoration.

That is why I built the Coaching OS.

**The Coaching OS is the daily operating system for your Light Signature Map. $14.33/mo.**

Here is what you get:

**Daily Practice Ecosystem**
- Morning Intention — choose one ray to lead from today
- Energy Audit — check your light levels midday
- Micro-Joy — notice and name one moment of joy (it is fuel, not frivolity)
- Reps — one behavioral rep for one ray, the way an athlete trains a specific muscle
- Evening Reflection — what showed up today, what stayed hidden, no judgment
- Weekly Scan — zoom out and see the pattern across seven days

**13 Ray-Specific Protocols**
Your toolkit has protocols designed for each ray. Not generic advice — specific behavioral training matched to your Light Signature Map. If your eclipse is in Ray 4, your toolkit has the exact protocol for training Ray 4.

**Growth Trajectory**
Retake the assessment over time. See how your rays shift. Watch your eclipse pattern change. Your map is not static — and the Coaching OS shows you the movement.

**Full Cosmic Report**
Your complete Light Signature visualization — every ray, every subfacet, your full operating system rendered in one view.

**[Start the Coaching OS — $14.33/mo]({{subscription_url}})**

$14.33 per month. Less than $0.48 per day. Less than a single coffee.

Cancel anytime. Your assessment data and Light Signature Map are yours forever regardless.

Here is the truth about leadership development: most programs give you insight and then leave you alone with it. The Coaching OS does not leave you alone. It gives you a practice for every day, a protocol for every ray, and a trajectory that shows you what is changing.

The leaders who move their Light Signature do not just see their map. They train it.

— Justin

**P.S.** You do not have to use every practice every day. Most leaders start with Morning Intention (30 seconds) and one Rep. That is enough to shift the pattern. The system meets you where you are — and grows with you.
