# Email 2: Top Ray Deep Dive

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "Your top ray is not what you think" — recommended
Safe bet. Curiosity gap built on something they already know — their top ray. "Not what you think" implies they have a surface understanding but the real meaning goes deeper. High open rate because they are still processing their results.

### B: "what your brightest ray is hiding"
Bold play. Lowercase, pattern interrupt. "Hiding" creates tension — their strongest capacity is concealing something? This reframes strength as complex rather than simple. Works because it matches the 143 Leadership principle that every ray has nuance.

### C: "The capacity you rely on most — and why it matters"
Personal touch. Descriptive, warm, no tricks. "Rely on" shifts from abstract scoring to daily lived experience. "Why it matters" promises practical meaning, not just data. Appeals to leaders who want application, not theory.

**Recommended A/B test:** A vs B
**Reason:** Tests whether the audience responds more to a challenge of their understanding ("not what you think") or to the idea that strength has hidden layers ("hiding"). The winner reveals how comfortable the audience is with complexity in their results.

## Preview Text
"The strongest ray in your map is telling you something most leaders miss."

## Send Timing
Day 3 — Tuesday or Thursday at 9:00 AM ET
Two days after the map delivery. They have had time to sit with their results. The initial emotional response has settled. Now they are ready for depth — not just "what are my scores" but "what do my scores mean." Morning send catches them in reflective mode before the day takes over.

Two days ago, you saw your Light Signature Map.

You probably noticed your top ray immediately. Most leaders do — it is the capacity that scores highest, the one that comes easiest, the one your team already knows you for.

Here is what most leaders miss about their top ray:

It is not just a strength. It is your default operating mode. When pressure rises, when decisions get complex, when you are tired — this is the ray your system reaches for first. Every time.

That is powerful. It is also a pattern.

**[Revisit My Light Signature Map]({{results_url}})**

The leaders who grow fastest are not the ones who double down on their top ray. They are the ones who notice when they are over-relying on it — using it as a hammer when the situation calls for something else.

Your top ray built your career. Your next level of leadership comes from the rays sitting underneath it — the ones with room to grow.

Look at your map again today. This time, instead of looking at the top, look at the middle. The rays scoring between 40 and 70. Those are the ones with the most room to move — and the ones that shift everything when they do.

Tomorrow is not too soon to start training one of them. Even two minutes of intentional practice changes the pattern.

**P.S.** Some leaders tell me their top ray feels so natural they forget it is a capacity at all. If that is you — that is exactly the point. The map shows you what you cannot see from the inside. And training starts with seeing.
