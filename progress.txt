Ralph Loop Iteration 1

- Found + fixed lead gates: /preview now requires name+email capture before unlocking the Stability Check and results; /group-coaching now gates full cohort content behind waitlist form completion.
- Found + fixed content leakage: /framework rewritten to teaser-only + CTA, and /resources framework copy reduced to a teaser with free Stability Check direction.
- Found + fixed animation drift: CosmicHeroV2 eclipse recovery now eases continuously to p=0.70 (no abrupt feel near 0.64); verified nova asset, letter-by-letter reveal, and moon 72% match.

Next loop priority (iteration 2): scan all remaining marketing long-form pages (especially /about, /cohorts, /rays/[slug], /methodology) and gate any section teaching detailed ray mechanics beyond teaser depth.

Ralph Loop Iteration 2

- Found + fixed ungated deep-framework pages: /methodology and /cohorts were still teaching too much in public, so both were converted to teaser-first pages with explicit "Discover your Rays — free Stability Check" CTAs.
- Found + fixed lead-gate message drift: /faq and /preview copy still implied no account/email friction; updated language to match required email unlock flow.
- Verified quality baselines remained intact: challenge and group-coaching gates are active, CosmicHeroV2 act-5/nova/moon/text sequence is intact, and Tron chart components still carry neon/scanline styling.

Next loop priority (iteration 3): audit dynamic /rays/[slug] pages and long-form /about + /outcomes copy for hidden methodology leakage, then add teaser gating blocks where detailed mechanics still appear.

Ralph Loop Iteration 3

- Found + fixed deeper leakage in long-form pages: /about and /outcomes had multi-sentence mechanism-level framework explanations; trimmed to teaser language and routed users to free Stability Check first.
- Found + fixed CTA alignment drift: /rays/[slug] and outcomes CTA now consistently use 'Discover your Rays — free Stability Check' instead of revealing deeper-framework framing.
- Verified all critical quality rails still hold: challenge and group-coaching are gated, preview requires email unlock before results, CosmicHeroV2 animation criteria pass, and Tron-vibe dashboard components are intact.

Next loop priority (iteration 4): audit non-marketing entry surfaces (e.g., /assessment/instructions, /results helper copy, shared components like RouteShellPage) for outdated 'no email/no account' claims that weaken gate clarity.
