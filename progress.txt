Ralph Loop Iteration 1

- Found + fixed lead gates: /preview now requires name+email capture before unlocking the Stability Check and results; /group-coaching now gates full cohort content behind waitlist form completion.
- Found + fixed content leakage: /framework rewritten to teaser-only + CTA, and /resources framework copy reduced to a teaser with free Stability Check direction.
- Found + fixed animation drift: CosmicHeroV2 eclipse recovery now eases continuously to p=0.70 (no abrupt feel near 0.64); verified nova asset, letter-by-letter reveal, and moon 72% match.

Next loop priority (iteration 2): scan all remaining marketing long-form pages (especially /about, /cohorts, /rays/[slug], /methodology) and gate any section teaching detailed ray mechanics beyond teaser depth.
