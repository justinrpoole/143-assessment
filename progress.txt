[2026-03-01] Phase: Gap Close — Assessment + Results
Status: DONE
Changes:
  - CRITICAL FIX: /assessment/scoring now calls POST /api/runs/[runId]/complete before animating.
    Previous version showed animation but never scored the assessment.
  - NEW: /results/rays/[rayId] — authenticated per-Ray detail page (all 9 Rays)
    Shows score ring, Shine/Eclipse subfacets, tool recommendation, micro-rep, science note,
    prev/next nav, science toggle.
  - FIX: /onboarding/complete now checks for completed runs and routes to /results or /assessment/setup
  - FIX: /onboarding/tools-first now routes through /onboarding/complete (not directly to /results)
  - TypeScript: 0 errors
