| ID | Question | Current Behavior | Conflicting Sources | Proposed Decision | Impact if Wrong | Status |
|----|----------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|-----------------|--------|
| ASM-001 | Should /toolkit be publicly accessible or auth-gated? | Middleware redirects to login (307). Smoke test expects 200. | `middleware.ts` gates it; `qa:smoke` expects public access | Toolkit is intentionally gated — update smoke test expectation to accept 307 for gated routes | Smoke test stays red, or toolkit is accidentally exposed | NEEDS OWNER DECISION |
| ASM-002 | Should all authenticated pages have PortalTabBar, or only the 4 primary pages? | Only portal, results, reps, toolkit have tab bar. 8 other auth pages (morning, micro-joy, growth, etc.) have PageShell without tabs. | No spec found defining which auth pages get tab bar | Extend PortalTabBar to all auth pages for consistent navigation | Users get stuck on tool pages without navigation back to portal | Decided: ALL AUTH PAGES — implemented via (portal) route group layout |
| ASM-003 | Are the 51 drift-scan violations real content issues or false positives from code/comments? | qa:drift-scan flags words like "failure", "broken", "personality test" across 26 files. Some may be intentional in canon explanations (e.g., "this is not a failure"). | Canon rules ban these words; some content uses them in reframe context ("not a failure") | Review each violation individually — reframe-context uses may be acceptable, but bare banned words must be replaced | If all are auto-fixed, canon reframe language may be damaged; if ignored, real violations persist | NEEDS OWNER DECISION |
| ASM-004 | Should /enterprise and /coach pages get full MarketingNav or are they intentionally minimal? | These pages render without MarketingNav. /enterprise uses a custom EnterpriseSalesPage component. | BRALPH invariant says every public page needs nav; these pages may be designed as focused landing pages | Add MarketingNav unless explicitly designed as standalone landing pages | If added, may break landing page conversion design; if omitted, users cannot navigate | Decided: ADD NAV — both now in (marketing) route group with automatic MarketingNav |
| ASM-005 | Is the "behind" in metadata descriptions an actual tone violation or acceptable in non-user-facing context? | Metadata descriptions ("the builder behind the framework") appear in Google search results — they ARE user-facing | qa:tone flags it; word "behind" is banned | Replace "behind" in metadata — search result snippets are user-facing copy | Minor — affects search snippets but not in-app experience | Decided: FIX (metadata IS user-facing) |
| ASM-006 | Canonical challenge route: /143 vs /143-challenge? | Both routes exist. /143 is the conversion-focused page with toolkit delivery. /143-challenge is the detailed 500-line explainer. Nav CTA points to /143. | Nav design brief asks about canonical route | Keep both routes. /143 = CTA target + toolkit form. /143-challenge = detailed explainer. Both serve distinct purposes. | If one is removed, content is lost or user flow breaks | Decided: KEEP BOTH |
| ASM-007 | Should /assessment/setup have a header? | Previously navless (user trapped). MarketingNav added in QA-025 fix. | Direction brief lists it as potential header-omission page. QA-025 flagged it as user-trapping. | Keep MarketingNav. Consistent with /assessment and /assessment/instructions. Users can navigate away. | If removed, users entering assessment flow are trapped again (QA-025 regression) | Decided: KEEP HEADER |
| ASM-008 | Should all authenticated portal pages have a desktop top nav? | Currently only PortalTabBar (mobile bottom). No top nav on desktop. QA-026. | BRALPH invariant says every page needs nav. PortalTabBar is mobile-only. | Add a lightweight portal top bar with logo + sign-out for desktop. Defer to future pass. | Desktop users have no navigation except footer. Usability gap on wide screens. | NEEDS OWNER DECISION |
