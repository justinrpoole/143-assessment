# Alpha Feedback Rubric

## Tagging Buckets
Use one primary bucket per comment:
- question_clarity
- report_resonance
- next_step_confidence
- upgrade_clarity
- checkout_friction
- morning_value
- microjoy_value
- share_motivation
- overall_experience

## What To Change Immediately
Ship in the next patch when feedback is:
- blocking task completion
- causing repeated confusion at the same step
- reducing confidence in next-step action
- creating clear purchase misunderstanding on `/upgrade`

## What To Defer
Move to later iteration when feedback is:
- purely stylistic preference
- edge-case flow outside alpha scope
- requested by one person with no supporting pattern

## Pattern Rules (Do Not Overreact)
- 1 comment = signal to monitor.
- 2 similar comments = investigate with next testers.
- 3+ similar comments = confirmed pattern, prioritize fix.

## Prioritization Grid
- High impact + high frequency: immediate
- High impact + low frequency: short-cycle review
- Low impact + high frequency: bundle improvements
- Low impact + low frequency: backlog

## Decision Cadence
- Daily during Day 0-Day 2 testing
- Mid-week consolidation (Day 3-Day 5)
- Final Alpha synthesis at Day 7
