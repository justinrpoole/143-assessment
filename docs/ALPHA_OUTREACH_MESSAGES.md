# Alpha Outreach Messages

## DM Invite (Short)
I’m opening a small Alpha (10-20 people) for 143 Leadership. It’s a focused OS-upgrade flow: quick preview, optional upgrade, and practical next-step REPs. Want in? It takes about 20 minutes and your feedback directly shapes launch.

## DM Invite (Long)
I’m running a private Alpha for 143 Leadership and I’d value your input. The experience is built around upgrading your internal operating system with clear next-step action.

Flow:
- quick entry (`/143` or `/toolkit`)
- preview (`/preview`)
- optional upgrade (`/upgrade`)
- results + report
- morning + micro-joy check

Total time is around 20-30 minutes. I’m looking for direct feedback on clarity, resonance, and what next step you’d actually take. If you’re open to it, I’ll send your link.

## Thank You + Link
Thank you. Here is your Alpha link: [insert link]

Please use it like you normally would and call out what feels clear, what feels unclear, and what REP you would do tomorrow.

## Day 2 Follow-Up
Quick check-in: what part stayed with you after yesterday, and did you choose a REP you can run today?

## Day 7 Follow-Up
One-week check-in: what changed most from this flow, and would you retake in the next 30 days?
