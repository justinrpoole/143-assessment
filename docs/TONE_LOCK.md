# Tone Lock (Justin Ray OS)

## Voice Core
- Warm authority.
- Direct, practical, action-first.
- Agency-forward framing.
- Primary metaphor: internal operating system (`Upgrade Your OS`).

## Non-Negotiables
- No deficit framing.
- No shame language.
- No therapy-coded prompting.
- No clinical phrasing.

## Banned Phrases
- `behind`
- `sleep debt`
- `take a breath`

## Required Direction
- Keep copy grounded in everyday micro-wins.
- Keep guidance deterministic: one clear next REP.
- Keep outcomes practical: aligned action, repeatable progress, measurable growth.
- Keep identity framing aspirational and human.

## Core Line
- We don't become, we are. You build it like a muscle. That's what REPs are.
