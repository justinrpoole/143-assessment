# Alpha Test Plan (10-20 Testers)

## Objective
Validate two outcomes:
1. It lands: people understand what they are seeing.
2. It moves people: they choose a concrete next REP.

## Who To Recruit (10-20)
Use a balanced mix:
- high-achievers who like structured performance systems
- everyday people who want practical momentum
- healthy skeptics who challenge vague language
- trusted friends who give direct feedback

Target composition:
- 3-5 high-achievers
- 3-5 everyday users
- 2-4 skeptics
- 2-4 friends/close-network testers

## Success Criteria
- 80% can explain their ray pair in 1 minute.
- 70% pick a REP within 24 hours.
- 60% say they would retake within 30 days (or subscribe).
- Confusion hotspots list stays under 3 items.

## Risks And Mitigations
### Risk: checkout confusion
- Signal: users hesitate at `/upgrade` and ask what unlocks now vs later.
- Mitigation: tighten offer labels and feature bullets in-place, keep CTA path simple.

### Risk: report feels too long
- Signal: users skip sections or cannot summarize the main takeaway.
- Mitigation: reinforce “Justin’s Focus” as first action anchor and prompt one next REP.

### Risk: question ambiguity
- Signal: users ask what a question means or answer inconsistently.
- Mitigation: log exact item IDs and phrases; queue wording updates for pattern-level issues.

## Timeline
### Day 0: invite
- Send invite with scope, time expectation, and route link.

### Day 1: run
- Tester completes guided flow from entry to results/report.
- Capture live comments and rubric scores.

### Day 2: follow-up
- Ask what stayed with them and whether their selected REP happened.

### Day 7: check-in
- Ask what changed, what stuck, and if they would retake.

## What To Track During Alpha
- Top confusion points by route (`/preview`, `/upgrade`, `/results`, `/reports`).
- REP selection rate within 24 hours.
- Share-card action intent.
- Morning and micro-joy first-use impressions.

## Decision Rules
- 1 similar comment = note it.
- 2 similar comments = monitor closely.
- 3+ similar comments = pattern, prioritize update.
