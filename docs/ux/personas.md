# User Personas — 143 Leadership Assessment

## Persona 1: The Plateau Leader

**Name:** Sarah, 38
**Role:** Director of Operations, 200-person company
**Experience:** 12 years in leadership

**Situation:** Sarah is good at her job. Her team delivers. But she feels stuck — like she is managing well but not leading differently. She has done DISC and StrengthsFinder through her company. She knows she is a "D" and an "Achiever." Neither has changed how she leads.

**Motivations:**
- Wants something that tells her what to *do*, not just who she *is*
- Seeks structured growth, not motivation
- Values evidence — she wants to see her own data change over time

**Frustrations:**
- Personality tests feel like horoscopes — interesting but not actionable
- Coaching sessions often lack structure — too much "how does that make you feel?"
- No way to measure whether development efforts are working

**143 value:** The 9-Ray model gives her trainable metrics. The 30-day plan gives her specific tools. The retake proves whether the work moved the needle. She does not need more labels. She needs a training protocol.

**Key journey moment:** Reading her Rise Path and recognizing the specific Ray she has been avoiding. The tool recommendation feels surprisingly specific.

## Persona 2: The Depleted High-Performer

**Name:** Marcus, 44
**Role:** VP of Engineering, Series C startup
**Experience:** 18 years, 6 in VP+ roles

**Situation:** Marcus scores high on Power (R4) and Purpose (R5) but his Presence (R3) and Joy (R2) are eclipsed. He is effective but running on fumes. His team respects his competence but does not feel psychologically safe around him. He knows something is off but frames it as "just needing a vacation."

**Motivations:**
- Needs permission to acknowledge depletion without seeing it as weakness
- Wants to understand the gap between his output and his experience of leading
- Looking for a framework that distinguishes burnout from skill gaps

**Frustrations:**
- Previous 360s told him to "be more approachable" with no protocol for how
- Coaching felt like therapy — he wants structure and specificity
- Company wellness programs feel performative

**143 value:** The Eclipse Snapshot names what he has been feeling — his low scores are not deficits, they are covered capacities. The distinction between "you cannot do this" and "you are depleted right now" changes his entire relationship to the data. The Presence Pause tool gives him a starting point that is not a personality overhaul.

**Key journey moment:** Seeing the Eclipse meter and realizing his emotional load score explains the gap he has been feeling. Not broken. Eclipsed.

## Persona 3: The Emerging Leader

**Name:** Priya, 29
**Role:** Senior Product Manager, recently promoted to lead a team of 6
**Experience:** 4 years, first leadership role

**Situation:** Priya was promoted because she was excellent individually. Now she leads a team and nobody taught her how. She reads leadership books but they feel abstract. She does not have a coach and her company does not have a formal development program.

**Motivations:**
- Wants a map for what "good leadership" actually looks like in practice
- Needs specific skills to build, not general advice
- Values self-directed learning — she will follow a structured program

**Frustrations:**
- Leadership advice is vague ("be authentic," "lead with empathy") — she wants specifics
- No baseline measurement of where she is
- Does not know what she does not know

**143 value:** The 9-Ray model gives her a vocabulary for leadership capacities she did not know existed. Her Light Signature (perhaps Intention + Connection) shows her natural pattern. Her bottom Ray shows her the skill to build first. The 10-week program gives her a self-directed path.

**Key journey moment:** Taking the assessment and discovering that leadership is a set of 9 trainable capacities, not a personality type. She can build what she is missing.

## Persona 4: The Executive Coach

**Name:** David, 52
**Role:** Independent executive coach, 15+ clients
**Experience:** 22 years in leadership, 8 as a coach

**Situation:** David uses multiple assessment tools with clients but none give him a structured debrief protocol. He spends time interpreting results for clients instead of creating conditions for clients to interpret themselves. He wants a tool that does the heavy lifting on data so he can focus on coaching.

**Motivations:**
- Needs a repeatable, structured debrief methodology
- Wants retake data to show ROI of coaching engagement
- Values ethical standards and non-shame language

**Frustrations:**
- Current tools (Hogan, EQi) are expensive and require separate certification per tool
- No tool distinguishes depletion from deficit — he has to make that call himself
- Retake comparison is manual and time-consuming

**143 value:** The assessment automates scoring and report generation. The 9-Ray Walkthrough gives him a debrief protocol. The Eclipse Snapshot handles the deficit-vs-depletion distinction. Retake comparison is built in. He can run a data-driven coaching engagement with a clear before/after.

**Key journey moment:** Running a client through the retake and seeing specific Rays move after targeted practice. The data validates the coaching.
