# Jobs To Be Done — 143 Leadership Assessment

## Core Functional Jobs

### Job 1: Measure where I actually am as a leader
**When** I feel stuck or sense a gap in my leadership...
**I want to** get an honest, specific measurement of my current capacities...
**So I can** know exactly what to work on instead of guessing.

**Current alternatives:** StrengthsFinder (labels, not metrics), 360 feedback (subjective, delayed), self-reflection (biased, unstructured)

**Why 143 wins:** 9 trainable Rays measured on a scale, not personality labels. Specific scores, not vague categories. Data that changes on retake.

### Job 2: Get a training plan I can actually follow
**When** I receive assessment results or development feedback...
**I want to** know exactly what to practice, with what tool, starting this week...
**So I can** make progress without hiring a coach or designing my own program.

**Current alternatives:** Generic "areas for development" lists, coaching sessions (expensive, unstructured), leadership books (informational but not actionable)

**Why 143 wins:** 30-day plan with specific tools matched to your lowest Ray. If/Then protocols. Daily rep system. 10-week structured program.

### Job 3: Know if I am growing
**When** I have been practicing leadership development for weeks or months...
**I want to** see measurable evidence that my capacities changed...
**So I can** validate that the work is working, not just feel like it is.

**Current alternatives:** Subjective self-assessment, annual performance reviews, re-taking personality tests (which should not change)

**Why 143 wins:** Retake the same 143 questions. Compare scores. See which Rays moved. The 36-pair matrix shows exactly what shifted and by how much.

## Core Emotional Jobs

### Job 4: Feel seen without being labeled
**When** I take an assessment...
**I want to** see results that reflect my actual experience, not a box I get put in...
**So I can** trust the data enough to act on it.

**Current alternatives:** MBTI ("you are an INTJ"), Enneagram ("you are a 3"), DISC ("you are a D") — all type-based, all fixed

**Why 143 wins:** Light Signature is a combination of your top two Rays, not a personality type. It can shift as you grow. No box. A pattern you can work with.

### Job 5: Understand why I feel depleted without being pathologized
**When** I am burned out, running on empty, or performing but not thriving...
**I want to** understand what is happening without being told I have a weakness...
**So I can** address the depletion instead of pushing harder on a skill I actually have.

**Current alternatives:** Therapy (appropriate for clinical concerns, not leadership development), wellness apps (generic), EAP programs (stigmatized)

**Why 143 wins:** Eclipse Snapshot distinguishes depletion from deficit. Low scores are framed as "temporarily covered," not broken. The first question is "what is covering this capacity?" not "how do you fix this weakness?"

## Core Social Jobs

### Job 6: Show my team what I am working on
**When** I want to model growth for my team...
**I want to** share what I am practicing and why, backed by data...
**So I can** normalize development and make it safe for others to grow too.

**Current alternatives:** Vulnerability talks (unstructured), "I am working on myself" (vague), nothing (most leaders)

**Why 143 wins:** Share cards, specific Ray focus, rep logging. A leader can say "I am training my Presence Ray this month" and their team sees the protocol in action.

---

### Job 7: Prove ROI on development investment
**When** my organization invests in leadership development...
**I want to** show measurable before/after data on leadership capacity...
**So I can** justify the investment and scale the program.

**Current alternatives:** 360 re-administration (expensive, subjective), engagement survey correlation (indirect), anecdotal testimonials

**Why 143 wins:** Pre/post assessment comparison with auditable signature pairs. Deterministic scoring. SHA-256 verified. The same inputs always produce the same outputs. Growth is measurable, not claimed.
