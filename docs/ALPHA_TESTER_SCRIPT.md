# Alpha Tester Script

## 5-Minute Onboarding Talk Track
"Thanks for joining Alpha. You are helping us validate whether this OS upgrade flow is clear and useful in real life. Your job is to use it exactly as you normally would and say what you notice. There are no wrong answers."

"As you move through each step, call out what feels clear, what feels unclear, and what you would do next. Keep your answers honest and practical. We are testing clarity and momentum, not perfect behavior."

"Please do not try to optimize your score. Use real responses from your current week."

## What Not To Do
- Do not overthink each question.
- Do not answer based on what sounds best.
- Do not skip unclear moments; call them out in real time.

## Task List (In Order)
1. Start at `/143` or `/toolkit`.
2. Complete `/preview`.
3. If willing, open `/upgrade` (purchase is optional in Alpha unless explicitly requested).
4. Complete one assessment run (if your account is entitled).
5. Read `/results` and `/reports`.
6. Generate one share card.
7. Visit `/morning` once and `/micro-joy` once.

## Cognitive Interview Prompts (Ask Exactly)
- "What did you think this question meant?"
- "What answer would you pick if you were having your best week?"
- "What line in your report felt most true?"
- "What part felt confusing or too generic?"
- "What’s the next REP you’d actually do tomorrow?"
