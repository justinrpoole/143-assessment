# 143 Leadership Voice Profile

## Voice Summary
Sounds like the friend who burned out at the top, built the system that brought them back, and is now sitting across from you saying what no one else will — with numbers to back it up. Direct without being cold. Proof-heavy without being academic. Every sentence earns the next one. The reader feels seen before they feel sold.

## Core Personality Traits
- **Visceral directness:** Short sentences that land like statements of fact. No hedging, no "might," no "perhaps." Says "That is not a flaw. That is your system protecting you" instead of "This could potentially be a protective mechanism."
- **Proof over promise:** Leads with specific numbers (143 questions, 15 minutes, 36 Light Signatures, 9 Rays, $43, N≥5). Never makes a claim without a measurement or mechanism behind it.
- **I-see-you empathy:** Opens with the reader's lived experience described so specifically they feel exposed. "You run the meeting. You hit the number. And by 6pm something is missing that you cannot name." Not sympathy — recognition.
- **Non-shame framing:** Eclipse is not failure. Depletion is not weakness. The system protects what it cannot trust yet. Everything is positioned as capacity that can be restored, not damage that needs fixing.

## Tone Spectrum

| Dimension | Position | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Formal ↔ Casual | Professional-casual | No contractions avoided, but no slang. Clean, adult, serious without being stiff. |
| Serious ↔ Playful | Mostly serious | Occasional wit in structure ("Not who you are. What you can build.") but never jokes. The stakes are real. |
| Reserved ↔ Bold | Bold | Strong claims backed by data. "Your brain is running a threat filter you never installed." No hedging. |
| Simple ↔ Sophisticated | Simple words, sophisticated ideas | "Eclipse" and "Ray" are the system's vocabulary. Everything else is plain English. Short words. Active voice. |
| Warm ↔ Direct | Direct first, warm underneath | "I see you" is warm. "That is not a motivation gap. That is your operating system." is direct. The warmth earns the directness. |

## Vocabulary

**Words/phrases to USE:**
- "I see you" — signature opener for commitment pages, creates instant recognition
- "Eclipse" — stress covering capacity (non-shame framing, never "failure" or "weakness")
- "Ray" — one of 9 trainable leadership capacities (always capitalised: "your Power Ray")
- "Light Signature" — unique top-2-Ray combination (one of 36)
- "Reps" — daily behavioural practices ("the reps are landing")
- "Operating system" / "OS" — the metaphor for the leadership capacity layer
- "Energy borrowing" — performing from depletion, not capacity
- "Rise Path" — personalised growth plan
- "Restored access" — what happens when eclipse lifts (not "recovery" or "healing")
- Specific numbers always: 143 questions, 15 minutes, 9 Rays, 36 signatures, 3 minutes, $43
- "That is not a [common label]. That is [reframe]." — signature sentence pattern
- "Not [what they expect]. [What it actually is]." — contrast pattern

**Words/phrases to AVOID:**
- "Comprehensive" / "robust" / "holistic" / "leverage" — corporate jargon
- "Journey" / "transformation" / "unlock your potential" — coaching clichés
- "Passionate about" / "committed to excellence" — empty descriptors
- "Soft skills" — never; these are trainable behavioural capacities
- "Broken" / "damaged" / "fix" — shame framing; use "eclipsed" / "covered" / "restore"
- "Maybe" / "might" / "could potentially" — hedging language
- "We believe" — vague; say what specifically and prove it
- "Innovative" / "cutting-edge" / "revolutionary" — marketing fluff
- "Self-care" without context — too generic; be specific about which protocol

**Jargon level:** Light — system-specific terms (Ray, Eclipse, Light Signature) are defined on first use, then used naturally. No academic jargon. No corporate-speak.

**Profanity:** Never. The gravity comes from directness, not edge.

## Rhythm & Structure

**Sentences:** Short. Then a longer one that earns its length. "You run the meeting. You hit the number. And by 6pm something is missing that you cannot name." Average 8-12 words. Fragments used for emphasis.

**Paragraphs:** 1-3 sentences. Heavy white space. Each paragraph earns the next. Never more than 4 sentences.

**Openings:** "I see you" pattern (describe their lived experience) → reframe → what the system does about it. Or: bold claim → proof → invitation.

**Formatting:** Gold kicker labels (uppercase, tracking-widest). Glass-card sections. Gold dividers between sections. Bullet checkmarks for features. No emojis in body copy (only in data card icons).

## POV & Address

**First person:** "I" when Justin is speaking (about page, coaching). No first person on product/framework pages — the system speaks through the reader's experience.
**Reader address:** "You" always. Direct, second person. "Your brain." "Your system." "Your Light Signature."
**Relationship stance:** The friend who figured it out first. Not a guru — a peer who got wrecked, built the tools, and is now handing them over. Experienced but never above. "I was where you are" energy without saying it.

## Platform Adaptations

| Platform | Tone Shift | Structure | Length |
|----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Email | Warmest — "I see you" energy, personal, one insight per email | Short paragraphs, one CTA, gold-on-dark visual feel | 150-250 words |
| LinkedIn | More data-forward, lead with the reframe, end with the number | Line breaks between sentences, hook in first line, no hashtags | 100-200 words |
| Twitter/X | Punchiest — one reframe per tweet, "Not X. Y." pattern | Single idea, strong opener, specific number | Under 280 chars |
| Blog/SEO | Same voice, more depth, more research citations, still short paragraphs | Headers, gold kickers, proof blocks, tool recommendations | 1500-2500 words |
| Landing Page | Most urgent, benefit-first, proof-heavy, free-first funnel | Short sentences, glass-card sections, repeated CTAs, stats blocks | 800-2000 words |

## Example Phrases

**On-brand (sounds like us):**
- "I see you rehearsing the conversation in the shower for the third day in a row."
- "That is not a flaw. That is your system protecting you from a risk it has not measured yet."
- "143 questions. 15 minutes. Not who you are. What you can build."
- "Your brain is running a threat filter you never installed."
- "Self-compassion is not soft. It is stability."
- "Growth is a delta. We give you the delta."

**Off-brand (doesn't sound like us):**
- "Unlock your full leadership potential with our comprehensive assessment tool." — Corporate, vague, no proof, no feeling
- "We're passionate about helping leaders on their transformation journey." — Cliché, empty, "we believe" energy
- "Take our innovative quiz to discover your personality type!" — Trivialises the science, "quiz" not "assessment," personality framing is wrong
- "You might find that some of your leadership capacities could potentially benefit from development." — Hedge city, says nothing

## Do's and Don'ts

**DO:**
- Lead with the reader's felt experience before introducing the system
- Use specific numbers (never "many" when you can say "9")
- Frame eclipse as coverage, not damage ("covered" not "broken")
- Make every CTA lead with free first (143 Challenge → Light Check → Assessment)
- Use the "Not X. Y." contrast pattern to reframe expectations
- End sections with a bridge to the next action
- Keep stat blocks to 3 items (visual rhythm)

**DON'T:**
- Open with the product — open with the person
- Use shame-based language about depletion or struggle
- Promise transformation — promise measurement and tools
- Skip the science — always name the mechanism (RAS, cortisol, prediction error)
- Write paragraphs longer than 4 sentences
- Use "just" to minimise ("just take the assessment")
- Lead CTAs with paid options — always free first
