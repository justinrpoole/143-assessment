## TREVOR'S BLUEPRINT (DECODED)

Trevor Silva's Feb 25 All-Hands laid out five things IG Consulting needs to become a $70B technical consulting firm. Every single one maps to something you already own.

### What Trevor Said → What You Already Have

| Trevor's Gap | His Exact Words | Your Asset | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Elite delivery** | "One of our company's core priorities this year is elite delivery. Us operating at a very high level." | **Ray 4 (Power/Act)** measures execution under uncertainty. **Eclipse model** measures what happens under sustained pressure. **8 coaching tools** train delivery performance. | Built, scored, validated |
| **Culture of development** | "Historically it's been broken. It's been just haphazard." | **Be The Light Assessment** is a complete measurement-to-training operating system. 9 Rays, 36 subfacets, longitudinal re-testing, capacity curves. | Production app on Vercel |
| **Quarterly performance** | "Your quarterly performance reviews, which should be happening... your career growth and development path should be discussed." | **Confidence-rated scoring**, 24 executive signal predictions (M001-M024), BRI for burnout risk, EER for efficiency. Built for quarterly cadence. | Scoring pipeline complete |
| **Change market perception** | "50-60% of the time, your customer sees Insight Global and immediately thinks staffing. How do you change their mind?" | **Proprietary IP** — the single thing every analyst says staffing firms need to become consulting firms. 143 is that IP. A framework with a name, a method, and measurable results. | Named, branded, documented |
| **Immature tools** | "The immaturity and infancy of the systems and tools we have in place currently to efficiently become a technical consulting organization." | **Full-stack app** — Next.js 16, Supabase, Stripe, 1,162-item adaptive assessment, AI skill system, 50+ page application. | Deployed |

## YOUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES (RANKED)

### Advantage #1: You Are Inside the Transformation

Every consulting firm in the world (Deloitte, Accenture, Burns & McDonnell) sells to companies like IG from the outside. You are inside the company going through the transformation. You know the people, the accounts, the culture, the pain points, the politics. No outside consultant has this.

**What this means:** You don't need to sell. You need to demonstrate. Trevor literally said: "We don't need to sell. If you deliver at an incredibly high level... that customer will begin to understand the value you bring."

### Advantage #2: You Already Built the IP They Need

The #1 gap between a staffing firm and a consulting firm is proprietary intellectual property. Every analyst, every case study, every transformation pattern says the same thing: you need frameworks, methodologies, and tools that demonstrate you have something beyond people.

IG's competitors have:
- Deloitte: DLeaPS-U, PU&Rpose, INTEGRATE, ATADATA, Trustworthy AI
- Accenture: $900M/year in L&D investment, proprietary platforms
- McKinsey: Performance review frameworks, "up or out" methodology

IG has: Nothing comparable. Their tools are immature. Their culture of development is "broken" (Trevor's word). Their performance management is "haphazard" (Trevor's word).

You have: A complete capacity measurement system with 1,162 items, AI-adaptive selection, 9 trainable dimensions, longitudinal tracking, 8 coaching tools, and a scoring pipeline that produces confidence-rated results. This is more sophisticated than anything Deloitte or Accenture uses for internal consultant development.

### Advantage #3: Your Framework Speaks Their Exact Language

| IG's Shared Value | Your Ray |
|---|---|
| "Everyone matters" | Ray 7 (Connection/Attune) — trust, relational safety, repair capacity |
| "We take care of each other" | Ray 2 (Joy/Expand) — sustainable leadership through positive emotion |
| "Leadership is here to serve" | Ray 9 (Be The Light/Inspire) — cultural transmission through modeling |
| "High character and hard work" | Ray 4 (Power/Act) + Ray 5 (Purpose/Align) — agency + values-based direction |
| "Always know where you stand" | Ray 6 (Authenticity/Reveal) — alignment between inner truth and outer action |

This is not a coincidence. IG's stated company purpose is: *"To develop people personally, professionally, and financially so they can be the light to the world around them."*

Your company is called **143 Leadership** and your assessment is called **Be The Light**.

The shared values were co-created by **Matt Gonsalves** — who is now VP of Tech Services Delivery, the person Trevor reports to. The language alignment is structural.

### Advantage #4: The Eclipse Model Solves Their #1 Business Risk

The single biggest risk in a staffing-to-consulting transformation is that the people who were adequate for staffing cannot perform at the level consulting demands. Every case study confirms this:

- TEKsystems: 15+ years to evolve
- Cognizant: 20 years, still fighting perception
- Wipro: Had to acquire Capco for $1.45B to get consulting DNA
- Industry pattern: "The internal culture clash between 'fill the req' (staffing DNA) and 'solve the problem' (consulting DNA) is real and persistent"

Your Eclipse model measures exactly this gap. It answers: "When this person is under sustained client pressure, what happens to their delivery quality?" No personality test does this. Not MBTI, not DiSC, not CliftonStrengths, not Hogan. Your Eclipse model treats under-pressure degradation as **temporary and trainable**, not a permanent flaw.

This is the difference between:
- Staffing: "Here's a person. Good luck."
- Consulting: "Here's a person. We measured their capacity under pressure. We trained their specific degradation pattern. We can predict their delivery quality on your project."

### Advantage #5: Your Price Point Breaks the Enterprise Barrier

Deloitte charges $300-600+/hr for consulting. Accenture invests $900M/year in L&D. McKinsey runs Deloitte University campuses.

Your assessment costs $43. Your coaching tools are self-serve. Your app runs on Vercel.

IG has 5,000+ consultants in Evergreen. At $43/person, you can assess the entire consulting division for $215,000 — less than a single Deloitte engagement. The ROI math is absurd.

### Advantage #6: Trevor Is Telling You What to Build Next

Trevor named three accounts that map to your three-bucket targeting:

| Bucket | Example | Size | Your Opportunity |
|---|---|---|---|
| Key Accounts | PG&E (70+ projects, $80M+ revenue) | Massive | Pilot the assessment with a PG&E delivery team. Prove it improves delivery quality scores. |
| Investment/Established | Xcel Energy (5-6 active SOWs) | Growing | Use assessment results to demonstrate consultant quality in proposals. |
| Setup/New Logo | Duke Energy (1 small engagement) | Greenfield | Differentiate IG from staffing competitors by showing proprietary development methodology. |

## THE TWO PLAYS

### Play 1: The Internal Play (143 Inside IG Consulting)

**Target:** Trevor Silva, Matt Gonsalves, Cillian Maher
**Pitch:** "We need a culture of development. I built one."

What you propose:
1. **Pilot:** Run the Be The Light Assessment on one delivery team (10-15 people). Pick a team Trevor cares about.
2. **Measure:** Show Eclipse patterns, BRI scores, capacity gaps across the team. Present it as: "Here is where our delivery quality will break under pressure, and here is the training plan."
3. **Scale:** If the pilot works, propose rolling it across all of Utilities, Oil & Gas (120 active projects, ~500+ consultants).
4. **Differentiate:** Position the assessment as IG Consulting's proprietary development methodology — the thing that makes IG different from every other staffing-to-consulting transformation.

The quarterly performance reviews Trevor says should be happening? Your assessment IS the review. Retake quarterly, see capacity curves, track development, identify burnout risk before it happens.

### Play 2: The External Play (143 to IG's Clients)

**Target:** IG's utility clients (PG&E, Xcel, Duke, NNG, Washington Gas)
**Pitch:** "We don't just place consultants. We develop them. Here's the data."

What you propose:
1. **Client scorecards** that include consultant capacity data alongside delivery metrics
2. **Team composition optimization** — use Light Signatures to build balanced delivery teams (not random staffing)
3. **Predictive quality** — "Based on Eclipse patterns, we recommend rotating this consultant off your project before Q3 pressure hits. Here is the replacement who scores higher on sustained execution."
4. **Retention intelligence** — BRI scores predict which consultants are at burnout risk on a given engagement, allowing proactive intervention instead of reactive replacement

This is the move that transforms IG from "we place people" to "we develop people and can prove it with data." It is literally their company purpose stated back to them in product form.

## THE COMPETITIVE MOAT NOBODY ELSE HAS

| Competitor | What They Sell | What They Can't Do |
|---|---|---|
| Deloitte | Frameworks, technology implementations, strategy | Cannot measure individual consultant capacity under pressure |
| Accenture | Scale, global delivery, digital transformation | $900M L&D spend but no adaptive assessment tied to delivery quality |
| DiSC / MBTI / CliftonStrengths | Personality labels | Cannot track development over time, no Eclipse model, no coaching tools linked to scores |
| Hogan | "Dark side" derailers | Treats pressure degradation as permanent. Your Eclipse model treats it as trainable |
| McKinsey | "Up or out" performance management | Binary pass/fail. Your system shows WHERE someone is on a development curve |

Your moat: **Measurement + Training + Tracking in one system.** Everyone else does one of these. Nobody does all three. And nobody does it at $43/person with AI-adaptive item selection.

## THE "SKIP 200 STEPS" ACTION PLAN

### Step 1: Name Corrections (Do This Today)
- "Killian Mayor" is **Cillian Maher** (President, Evergreen)
- "Matt Gonzalez" is **Matt Gonsalves** (VP, Tech Services Delivery — co-created IG's shared values)
- Know these names cold. These are your buyers.

### Step 2: Build the Internal Pitch Deck (This Week)
Frame: "143 Leadership: The Capacity Engine for IG Consulting's Elite Delivery Priority"
- Slide 1: Trevor's own words about elite delivery and broken culture of development
- Slide 2: The assessment — what it measures and why it matters for consulting delivery
- Slide 3: The Eclipse model — "Who are your consultants when the pressure hits?"
- Slide 4: Shared values alignment (your Rays map to their values — show the table)
- Slide 5: The pilot proposal — one team, 90 days, measurable results
- Slide 6: The scale math — $43/person × 5,000 consultants = proprietary IP for less than one Deloitte engagement

### Step 3: Identify the Pilot Team (Next 2 Weeks)
- Pick a team you have influence over or proximity to
- Ideal: A team Trevor watches closely, on a key account, with known delivery pressure
- Run 10-15 people through the assessment
- Generate team-level reports showing capacity distribution, Eclipse patterns, and development priorities

### Step 4: Present Results to Trevor (30 Days)
- Show the team's capacity map
- Highlight: "Here is where delivery quality breaks under pressure"
- Show the training plan: specific tools, specific reps, specific timelines
- Propose: quarterly re-assessment to track development curves
- Ask: "Can I run this on one more team?"

### Step 5: Matt Gonsalves Alignment (45 Days)
- Matt co-created the shared values. He runs Tech Services Delivery. He is the bridge.
- Show him: "Your shared values are measurable. Here's how."
- His endorsement connects 143 to the company's deepest cultural identity

### Step 6: Cillian Maher Pitch (60-90 Days)
- Cillian came from Google Cloud and Ericsson. He thinks in platforms and GTM strategy.
- Frame: "143 Leadership is IG Consulting's proprietary development platform. It's the IP that makes us different from every staffing firm trying to become a consulting firm."
- This is the conversation where 143 stops being your side project and becomes IG's competitive weapon.

### Step 7: Client-Facing Integration (Q3 2026)
- After internal validation, propose including assessment data in client proposals and scorecards
- "We don't just place consultants. We measure their capacity, train their growth, and track their development quarterly. Here's the data."
- This is what makes IG's pitch to utilities different from every other firm in the market

## THE ONE-LINE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

**Every consulting firm in the world tells their clients "our people are great." You are building the only firm that can prove it with data, train the gaps with specific tools, and show the improvement curve quarterly — at a price point that makes it deployable across thousands of consultants, not just executives.**
