# Internal Transformation Play: 143 Inside IG Consulting

> Protocol for positioning 143 Leadership as IG Consulting's proprietary development platform

---

## CONTEXT

Insight Global ($4.1B, #4 US staffing firm) is transforming into a technical consulting organization. The professional services division (Evergreen) is rebranding to **IG Consulting** in April 2026. The company's stated goal is to compete with Deloitte ($70.5B) and Accenture ($64B) on technical consulting while differentiating through human connection and shared values.

**The gap:** Every analyst and case study confirms that staffing-to-consulting transformations require proprietary IP — frameworks, methodologies, and tools that prove you have something beyond people. IG currently has no proprietary development methodology. Their culture of development is "broken" and "haphazard" (Trevor Silva, Senior Director of Delivery, Feb 25, 2026).

**The asset:** 143 Leadership's Be The Light Assessment is a complete capacity measurement-to-training operating system that directly addresses IG's three stated priorities: elite delivery, culture of development, and quarterly performance management.

## THE 7-PHASE PLAYBOOK

### Phase 1: Quiet Demonstration (Weeks 1-2)

**Objective:** Start living the framework visibly without pitching anything.

Actions:
- Use Ray language naturally in team interactions ("I want to check our team's capacity under pressure on this deliverable" instead of "are we staffed right")
- Apply the 8 coaching tools in your own work visibly — 90-Second Window before client calls, Go First in team meetings, Presence Pause during escalations
- When delivery issues arise, frame them in capacity terms: "This isn't a skills gap, it's a sustained pressure pattern. The team's execution capacity is degrading under load."
- Document 3-5 specific instances where capacity framing produced better outcomes than traditional staffing framing

**Gate:** You have 3+ documented examples of capacity-based thinking producing better delivery outcomes.

### Phase 2: Informal Introduction to Trevor (Weeks 3-4)

**Objective:** Plant the seed without a formal pitch.

Approach:
- Reference the All-Hands: "You talked about elite delivery and culture of development. I've been working on something that directly addresses both."
- Frame it as YOUR development, not a product pitch: "I built a framework for measuring leadership capacity under pressure. I've been using it on myself and I want to show you what it produces."
- Show your OWN assessment results. Walk Trevor through your 9 Ray scores, your Eclipse pattern, your development plan. Make it personal, not corporate.
- Ask: "Would it be useful if I ran a few people on my team through this? No cost, just data."

**Gate:** Trevor says yes to a small informal pilot.

### Phase 3: Pilot Execution (Weeks 5-8)

**Objective:** Generate undeniable data from a real delivery team.

Pilot design:
- 10-15 people on a team Trevor watches closely
- Ideally a key account team with known delivery pressure (PG&E or similar)
- Run each person through the full Be The Light Assessment
- Generate individual reports (participant + quick read format)
- Generate a TEAM-LEVEL composite showing:
  - Aggregate capacity distribution across 9 Rays
  - Team Eclipse patterns (where does this team break under pressure?)
  - BRI distribution (who is at burnout risk?)
  - Light Signature diversity (is the team balanced or lopsided?)
  - Specific capacity gaps mapped to their current delivery challenges

**Deliverables:**
1. Team Capacity Dashboard (one-page visual)
2. Top 3 delivery risks based on Eclipse patterns
3. Specific development plan with tools and reps per person
4. Predicted improvement timeline (90-day re-assessment targets)

**Gate:** Team data tells a clear story that connects to real delivery outcomes Trevor cares about.

### Phase 4: Results Presentation to Trevor (Week 9-10)

**Objective:** Convert pilot data into a business case.

Presentation framework:
1. **The Data:** "Here is what the assessment revealed about this team's capacity"
2. **The Risk:** "Here is where delivery quality will degrade under sustained pressure — and it maps to the patterns we've already seen on this account"
3. **The Plan:** "Here are the specific training protocols for each person. They take 90 seconds to 5 minutes per day. No classroom time. No workshops."
4. **The Ask:** "Let me re-assess in 90 days. If capacity scores improve and delivery metrics hold or improve, can I present this to Matt?"
5. **The Frame:** "This is the proprietary IP that makes us different from every other staffing firm trying to become a consulting firm. Deloitte has DLeaPS-U. We could have this."

**Gate:** Trevor agrees to a second team or escalates to Matt Gonsalves.

### Phase 5: Matt Gonsalves Alignment (Weeks 11-14)

**Objective:** Connect the framework to IG's deepest cultural identity.

Matt's unique position:
- He co-created the shared values
- He runs all of Tech Services Delivery
- He's been at IG for 19 years — he IS the culture

The conversation:
1. Show the shared values → Rays mapping table
2. Show the pilot data: "Your values are now measurable. Here is what they look like as data."
3. Frame: "Every consulting firm talks about values. We can SCORE them, TRACK them, and TRAIN them. That's the difference between culture as a poster on the wall and culture as a competitive advantage."
4. Connect to his operational reality: "Across your 7 industries, you need a consistent development methodology. This works regardless of whether someone is on a utility project or a healthcare project because it measures fundamental capacity, not domain skills."

**Gate:** Matt endorses the framework and facilitates a conversation with Cillian Maher.

### Phase 6: Cillian Maher Executive Pitch (Weeks 15-18)

**Objective:** Position 143 as IG Consulting's proprietary development platform.

Cillian's lens (Google Cloud, Ericsson background):
- He thinks in platforms, not programs
- He thinks in GTM strategy, not internal tools
- He thinks in competitive differentiation, not HR initiatives

The pitch:
1. **Market context:** "The staffing-to-consulting transformation takes 10-15 years. The #1 accelerant is proprietary IP. We don't have any. Deloitte has 5+ proprietary platforms. Accenture spends $900M/year on L&D."
2. **The platform:** "143 Leadership is a capacity measurement platform that assesses 9 trainable dimensions, tracks development longitudinally, and connects scores to specific coaching tools. It runs on AI-adaptive item selection from a 1,162-item bank."
3. **The GTM angle:** "We can put this in client proposals. 'We don't just place consultants. We measure their capacity, train their growth, and track their development quarterly. Here's the data.' No staffing firm can say this. Most consulting firms can't say this."
4. **The math:** "$43/person. 5,000 consultants = $215K to assess the entire consulting division. That's less than one Deloitte engagement."
5. **The brand alignment:** "Your company purpose is 'to develop people so they can be the light.' The assessment is called Be The Light. This isn't a coincidence. This is alignment."

**Gate:** Cillian authorizes enterprise-wide pilot or formal integration into IG Consulting's development infrastructure.

### Phase 7: Client-Facing Integration (Q3-Q4 2026)

**Objective:** Transform 143 from internal tool to market differentiator.

Applications:
1. **Proposal differentiation:** Include consultant capacity data in client proposals. "Here are the capacity profiles of the team we're assigning to your project."
2. **Team composition optimization:** Use Light Signatures to build balanced delivery teams. "This team has a Power-Connection lead, a Presence-Purpose anchor, and a Joy-Possibility innovator."
3. **Client scorecards:** Add development tracking to monthly/quarterly delivery reports. "Your delivery team improved 18% in sustained execution capacity this quarter."
4. **Predictive quality:** "Based on Eclipse patterns, we recommend rotating this consultant before Q3 pressure hits. Here is the replacement who scores higher on sustained execution."
5. **Retention intelligence:** "BRI scores indicate this consultant is approaching burnout risk on your engagement. We're deploying targeted recovery protocols."

## OBJECTION HANDLING

| Objection | Response |
|---|---|
| "We already use DiSC/MBTI/CliftonStrengths" | "Those measure personality — what you ARE. This measures capacity — what you CAN BUILD. And it tracks development over time, which none of those do." |
| "This sounds like HR, not delivery" | "BRI predicts burnout before it hits your project timeline. Eclipse patterns predict where delivery quality degrades under client pressure. This is delivery intelligence, not HR paperwork." |
| "We can't afford another tool" | "$43/person. Your team of 15 costs less than a team dinner. And it produces data you can put in client proposals." |
| "How is this different from Hogan?" | "Hogan calls pressure degradation a 'derailer' — a permanent flaw. We call it an Eclipse pattern — a temporary state you can train. That's the difference between writing someone off and developing them." |
| "We need to focus on delivery, not assessments" | "This IS delivery. The assessment takes 20-30 minutes. The coaching tools take 90 seconds each. The data tells you which consultants can handle which pressure types on which engagements. It makes every staffing decision smarter." |
| "Leadership won't go for this" | "Your CEO's stated purpose is 'to develop people so they can be the light.' The assessment is called Be The Light. The shared values map one-to-one to the 9 Rays. This is more aligned with IG's identity than anything else in the market." |
