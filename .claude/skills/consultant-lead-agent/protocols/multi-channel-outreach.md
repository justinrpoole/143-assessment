# Multi-Channel Outreach Protocol

## 1. Purpose

Single-channel outreach is a coin flip. You send an email, it lands or it does not. The lead sees it or they do not. They reply or they do not. One channel gives you one shot at one moment in time through one medium.

Multi-channel outreach is a system. Each touch on each channel reinforces the others. When someone gets your email and ignores it, then sees your LinkedIn comment on their post, then gets a second email with a different angle, then sees your name come up in a conversation with a mutual contact — you are no longer a stranger in their inbox. You are a known quantity in their professional world.

This protocol coordinates touches across six channels — email, LinkedIn, phone, conference, referral, and direct mail — so that each reinforces the others without overwhelming the target. The goal is omnipresence without annoyance. The line between "this person is everywhere" and "this person is stalking me" is frequency, relevance, and value. This protocol manages all three.

**Core principles:**
1. Never hit the same channel twice in a row without adding value between touches.
2. Every touch across every channel should be independently valuable (if they only ever see this one message, it should still make sense).
3. Channel escalation follows engagement signals, not arbitrary timelines.
4. When a lead responds on any channel, ALL other channel activity pauses until that conversation thread resolves.
5. More channels does not mean more messages. It means the same volume distributed strategically across multiple surfaces.

## 2. Channel Stacking Sequences

### Sequence A: "The Full Court Press"

**Trigger:** Lead score 90+, deal potential $250K+, active trigger event within last 30 days
**Duration:** 30 days active, then 60-day nurture
**Total touches:** 9-12 across all channels
**Channel mix:** Email (4), LinkedIn (3-4), Phone (1-2), Direct Mail (1)

| Day | Channel | Action | Content |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Research | Deep research: regulatory filings, 10-K, LinkedIn, company news, org chart | Build target dossier (Tier 3 personalization) |
| 1 | LinkedIn | Send connection request with 300-char custom note | Reference specific trigger event at their company |
| 3 | Email | Email #1: Trigger Opener | Specific trigger reference, named pain point, specific deliverable offer |
| 5 | LinkedIn | Engage with their post (substantive comment) | Add a data point or insight related to their post topic |
| 7 | Email | Email #2: Different Angle | New angle — industry trend, peer comparison, or relevant case study |
| 8 | LinkedIn | Engage with another post or share relevant content | Continue building visibility and credibility |
| 10 | LinkedIn | Send DM with value-add content | Share relevant article, analysis, or data point. No pitch. |
| 14 | Email | Email #3: Diagnostic Offer | Direct offer of specific diagnostic. Include scope, timeline, and outcome. |
| 17 | Phone | Call attempt #1 | If no response to 3 emails + LinkedIn DM. Reference emails sent. |
| 21 | Direct Mail | Send package (Option A or B from outreach agent protocol) | Industry report or company-specific diagnostic teaser |
| 25 | Phone | Call attempt #2 (if no response to call #1) | Reference the package. "Wanted to make sure it arrived." |
| 28 | Email | Break-up email | Final email. Leave door open. No guilt. Pure respect for their time. |
| 30-90 | LinkedIn | Nurture only | Engage with posts monthly. No outreach. Let them come to you. |

**Break-up email template:**
"[Name] — I've reached out a few times about [trigger] and haven't heard back, so I'll take the hint. If [Company]'s situation changes or you need help with [capability] down the road, I'm easy to find. In the meantime, here's a [relevant resource] that might be useful regardless. Best of luck with [specific project/challenge]."

**Escalation triggers within Sequence A:**
- If LinkedIn connection accepted within 48 hours of request: Skip to Phase 3 engagement immediately
- If email opened 3+ times on same day: Move phone call up to next business day
- If DM gets a reply (even a short one): Pause email sequence, continue conversation on LinkedIn
- If direct mail tracking shows delivery: Call within 3-5 business days

---

### Sequence B: "The Warm Approach"

**Trigger:** Lead score 75-89, warm referral path available (mutual connection willing to make intro)
**Duration:** 21 days active, then nurture
**Total touches:** 6-8 across channels
**Channel mix:** Referral (1), Email (3-4), LinkedIn (2), Phone (1)

| Day | Channel | Action | Content |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Referral | Ask mutual connection for introduction | Use intro request template from outreach agent protocol |
| 2 | Email | Follow-up to intro (within 24 hrs of intro being made) | Reply-all thanking connector, then direct thread to target. Reference intro, offer specific value. |
| 5 | Email | Email #2: Value proposition | Specific deliverable offer mapped to their trigger. More detail than intro email. |
| 7 | LinkedIn | Connection request | Reference the mutual connection and the email conversation |
| 10 | Email | Email #3: Diagnostic offer | Direct offer with scope, timeline, price. Binary CTA with 2 time slots. |
| 14 | Phone | Call | Reference the intro and prior emails. "Following up on the intro from [connector]. Had a chance to review the [deliverable]?" |
| 18 | LinkedIn | DM if connected, or engage with their post if not | Value-add content or direct meeting request |
| 21 | Email | Break-up email | Same structure as Sequence A break-up. Leave door open. |

**Critical rule:** If the mutual connection makes the intro and the target does not respond within 5 business days, ask the connector for intel: "Hey [connector], [target] hasn't replied yet. Any sense of whether the timing is off or if there's a better way to reach them?" Connectors often have context you do not.

**If intro is not made (connector does not follow through):**
- Wait 7 days after your request
- Send a gentle nudge: "Hey [connector], no rush on the intro to [target]. If the timing isn't right or you'd rather not, totally understand. Just wanted to follow up."
- If still no intro after 14 days: Abandon referral path. Switch lead to Sequence C or A based on score.

---

### Sequence C: "The Long Game"

**Trigger:** Lead score 60-74, no active urgency, no referral path, trigger is mild or aging
**Duration:** 12 weeks active, then ongoing nurture
**Total touches:** 6-8 over 12 weeks
**Channel mix:** Email (4), LinkedIn (2-3)

| Week | Channel | Action | Content |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Email | Email #1: Value-add (no pitch) | Industry insight, relevant data point, or analysis. Establish expertise. Zero mention of your services. |
| 3 | Email | Email #2: Light touch | Another industry insight with a light mention of your capability. "This is the kind of thing we help Ohio utilities with." One sentence, not a pitch. |
| 5 | LinkedIn | Connection request | Reference the emails: "Sent you a couple of industry insights — thought we should connect here too." |
| 7 | Email | Email #3: Case study or diagnostic teaser | More direct. Share a case study that maps to their company profile. Or tease a diagnostic: "We built a [diagnostic] specifically for companies in your position." |
| 9 | LinkedIn | Engage with their content (if active) | Comment on posts, share their content, build relationship |
| 11 | Email | Email #4: Soft close | "I've shared a few things over the past couple months. If any of it resonated, I'm happy to go deeper. If not, no hard feelings — I'll keep sharing useful stuff when I come across it." |
| 12+ | Monthly | LinkedIn engagement + monthly email nurture | One valuable email per month. Continue LinkedIn engagement. Monitor for trigger events. |

**Trigger upgrade rule:** If at any point during Sequence C a new trigger event fires for this company (regulatory filing, M&A, leadership change, RFP), immediately upgrade to Sequence A or B based on the new score.

---

### Sequence D: "Post-Conference"

**Trigger:** Met the person at a conference or industry event. Have business card or contact info. Conversation was substantive (Temperature 3+).
**Duration:** 14-21 days active
**Total touches:** 5-7
**Channel mix:** Email (3), LinkedIn (2), Phone (1)

| Day | Channel | Action | Content |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1-2 | Email | Follow-up email (within 48 hrs of event) | Reference SPECIFIC conversation points. Not "great meeting you at [event]" — reference the exact topic you discussed, their specific challenge, what you promised to send. |
| 2-3 | LinkedIn | Connection request | "Great talking at [event] about [specific topic]. Let's stay connected." |
| 5-7 | Email | Email #2: Deliver promised resource | Send whatever you promised during the conversation. Article, analysis, case study, intro. If you didn't promise anything, send something relevant to their stated challenge. |
| 10 | Phone | Call to continue conversation | "Hey [Name], we talked at [event] about [topic]. I sent over [resource]. Wanted to see if it was useful and if it makes sense to continue the conversation." |
| 14 | Email | Email #3: Meeting request or diagnostic offer | "Based on our conversation about [challenge], I think our [diagnostic] would be directly relevant. It covers [scope]. Would 20 minutes next week work?" |
| 18-21 | LinkedIn or Email | Final touch | If no response: nurture sequence. If partial engagement: one more value-add touch before parking. |

**Critical rule:** Post-conference follow-up has the highest conversion rate of any outreach type because you have already built rapport. Speed is critical. Every hour you wait reduces conversion probability. The 48-hour window is a maximum, not a target. Aim for same-day follow-up when possible.

---

### Sequence E: "Post-RFP Response"

**Trigger:** You submitted an RFP response. Waiting for evaluation. Want to stay top-of-mind without being pushy.
**Duration:** Matches the RFP evaluation timeline (typically 4-8 weeks)
**Total touches:** 3-5 (light touch — do not annoy the evaluation committee)
**Channel mix:** Email (2-3), LinkedIn (1-2)

| Timing | Channel | Action | Content |
|---|---|---|---|
| Day 1 (post-submission) | Email | Confirmation email | "Submitted our response. Happy to answer any questions or provide additional detail on [specific section]. Here's a direct line if the evaluation team needs anything: [phone]." |
| Week 2 | LinkedIn | Engage with evaluator's content | If you know who is on the evaluation committee, engage with their LinkedIn posts. Not about the RFP — about their general professional content. Build familiarity. |
| Week 3-4 | Email | Value-add touch | Share a relevant industry update, article, or analysis. Not related to the RFP directly — demonstrate ongoing value and expertise. "Came across this and thought it might be relevant to your team's work on [broader topic]." |
| Week 5-6 | Email | Gentle check-in | "Wanted to check in on the timeline for [project name]. No rush — just want to make sure I'm available for any questions that come up during evaluation." |
| After decision | Email | Win or lose follow-up | If won: Transition to project kickoff. If lost: "Appreciate the opportunity. Any feedback on our proposal would be valuable for future opportunities. Would you be open to a brief debrief?" |

**Critical rule:** After submitting an RFP, do NOT run any other outreach sequence to anyone at that company. The RFP process is formal. Running a parallel informal sequence looks desperate and unprofessional.

---

### Sequence F: "Re-Engagement After Cold Period"

**Trigger:** Lead was previously in active pursuit (Sequence A, B, or D), went through full cooldown period (60-90 days), and a new trigger event has occurred
**Duration:** 14-21 days
**Total touches:** 5-7
**Channel mix:** Email (3), LinkedIn (2), Phone (1 if prior relationship)

| Day | Channel | Action | Content |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Email | Re-engagement opener | "It's been a few months since we last connected. I noticed [NEW trigger event] at [Company] and thought it was worth reaching out again. The situation has changed since [original trigger], and [new angle based on new trigger]." |
| 3 | LinkedIn | Engage with recent post or share relevant content | Re-establish visibility. If previously connected, DM with insight about the new trigger. |
| 7 | Email | Email #2: New value proposition | Different deliverable or angle than the original sequence. They already saw and ignored the old pitch. Bring something new. |
| 10 | LinkedIn | DM or continued engagement | If connected: DM with specific value. If not: continue post engagement. |
| 14 | Email | Email #3: New diagnostic offer | "Since [new trigger], we've developed a [new or updated diagnostic] that specifically addresses [new challenge]. It covers [scope]. Worth 20 minutes?" |
| 17 | Phone | Call (only if you had prior direct contact) | Reference prior relationship: "We talked back in [month] about [original trigger]. The situation at [Company] has changed with [new trigger], and I think there's a stronger fit now." |
| 21 | Email | Break-up | If no response, break-up email. Move to long-term nurture with quarterly check-ins. |

**Critical rule:** Never re-engage with the exact same message or angle that failed the first time. If your pipeline management pitch did not work 90 days ago, a slightly reworded pipeline management pitch will not work now. You need a genuinely new trigger and a genuinely new angle.

---

### Sequence G: "Competitive Displacement"

**Trigger:** Intelligence indicates the lead is unhappy with their current vendor/consultant. Signals include: job postings for capabilities the vendor should be providing, public complaints, leadership change at the vendor, vendor losing other clients in the industry.
**Duration:** 21-30 days
**Total touches:** 6-8
**Channel mix:** Email (3), LinkedIn (2), Referral (1 if available), Phone (1)

| Day | Channel | Action | Content |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Research | Gather competitive intelligence | What does the current vendor provide? Where are the gaps? What are the complaints? Do NOT badmouth the competitor — understand them. |
| 2 | Referral | If available, warm intro through shared connection | Ideal if the connector left the competitor or worked with both firms. |
| 3 | Email | Email #1: Problem-aware opener | "I've been watching [Company]'s [specific area] closely. Based on [public signals], it looks like the current approach to [function] may not be scaling with [trigger]. We've helped [similar company] transition from [competitor's approach] to [your approach] with [specific result]." |
| 7 | LinkedIn | Connection request or DM | "Would love to connect — I work with several Ohio [industry] companies on [function] and have some relevant perspective." |
| 10 | Email | Email #2: Case study email | Share a case study where you successfully displaced or complemented a competitor's work. Focus on results, not on criticizing the competitor. |
| 14 | LinkedIn | Engage with their content | Continue building credibility and familiarity |
| 17 | Phone | Call | "I sent a couple of notes about [function] at [Company]. I know you're working with [current vendor type] on this, but based on what I'm seeing, there might be gaps worth addressing. Worth a conversation?" |
| 21 | Email | Email #3: Diagnostic offer | "Our [diagnostic] is designed to evaluate [function] performance independently. It's not about replacing anyone — it's about making sure [Company] is getting the outcomes you need. $[price], [timeline], delivered as [format]." |

**Ethics boundary:** Never disparage the competitor by name. Never use inside information obtained unethically. Never contact the competitor's employees for intelligence. Focus on the client's outcomes, not on the competitor's failures. If the competitor is doing fine and the client is happy, this sequence should not run.

## 3. Channel Conflict Resolution

When multiple channels are active simultaneously, conflicts arise. Two messages on the same day from the same person on different channels feels like harassment, not strategy. These rules prevent conflicts.

### Rule 1: Never Double-Touch Same Day
- Never send an email AND a LinkedIn DM on the same day
- Never call AND send an email on the same day (exception: if they opened your email 3+ times that same day, a call is warranted because they are actively reading your message)
- Never send a LinkedIn connection request and an InMail on the same day

### Rule 2: Response Channel Dominance
- If they reply on ANY channel, stop ALL other channel sequences immediately
- Respond on the channel they chose. That is their preferred communication medium.
- Example: If they reply to your LinkedIn DM but have been ignoring your emails, stop emailing. They are telling you they prefer LinkedIn.
- Resume other channels only if the reply-channel conversation goes cold for 14+ days

### Rule 3: Engagement Signal Routing
- If they connect on LinkedIn but ignore emails: Switch to LinkedIn-primary. Reduce email to monthly nurture.
- If they open emails consistently but never reply and are not on LinkedIn: Try phone. They are reading but need a different medium to act.
- If they reply to a referral intro but ignore your direct outreach: They trust relationships, not cold outreach. Find more warm intro paths.
- If they engage with your LinkedIn posts but ignore DMs: They like your content but are not ready for a conversation. Continue content engagement. Do not escalate DMs.

### Rule 4: Channel Priority Hierarchy
When you need to choose one channel over another (e.g., limited time, cooldown approaching):

1. Reply channel (always respond where they responded)
2. Referral introduction (highest conversion, use whenever available)
3. Phone (highest engagement rate for warm leads)
4. LinkedIn DM (more personal than email, less intrusive than phone)
5. Email (workhorse channel, reliable but easy to ignore)
6. LinkedIn engagement (passive, builds awareness, low commitment)
7. Direct mail (expensive, slow, reserved for highest-value targets)
8. InMail (expensive, low response rate, last resort for unconnected targets)

---

## 4. Cross-Channel Messaging Consistency

### Core Value Proposition Alignment

Every message across every channel should communicate the same underlying value proposition, adapted to the channel's format and tone. The lead should recognize a consistent thread across all touchpoints.

**Consistency rules:**
- Same trigger reference across all channels. If your email mentioned the PUCO rate case filing, your LinkedIn DM should reference the same filing. Do not introduce a completely different topic on a different channel.
- Same core promise. If you are offering a compliance gap analysis in email, your LinkedIn DM should reference the same capability. Do not pitch a workforce study on LinkedIn when your email offered compliance analysis.
- Same persona. Your email tone, LinkedIn tone, phone tone, and direct mail tone should all sound like the same person. Formal in email, formal on LinkedIn. Casual in email, casual on LinkedIn. Do not be corporate in email and breezy on LinkedIn.

### Channel-Specific Format Adaptation

**Email:** Detailed. 6-10 sentences for Email #1. Room for data points, case study references, specific deliverable descriptions. Professional but direct.

**LinkedIn Connection Request:** Ultra-concise. 300 characters max. One reference point (trigger, mutual connection, or their post). No pitch.

**LinkedIn DM:** Conversational. 3-5 sentences. Feels like a peer-to-peer message, not a sales email. Value-first (share something useful), ask second.

**Phone/Voicemail:** Concise and warm. 30-60 seconds. Voice conveys what text cannot — enthusiasm, expertise, sincerity. Lead with the trigger, name the deliverable, offer a specific next step.

**Direct Mail:** Tangible and personal. Handwritten elements where possible. The medium IS the message — you cared enough to send a physical package. Content should be substantial (not a flyer) and specific to their situation.

### Escalating Specificity Model

Across a multi-channel sequence, each successive touch should be MORE specific than the last, regardless of channel:

1. First touch (any channel): General trigger reference + general capability statement
2. Second touch (any channel): Specific company impact of the trigger + specific deliverable name
3. Third touch (any channel): Named pain points at their company + relevant case study with quantified outcomes
4. Fourth touch (any channel): Specific diagnostic scope, timeline, and price + specific next step with calendar options

This escalation builds credibility. Touch #1 shows you know their industry. Touch #4 shows you know THEIR company.

## 5. Timing Coordination Matrix

### Sequence A: Full Court Press — Visual Calendar

```
Week 1                    Week 2                    Week 3                    Week 4
Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri       Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri       Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri       Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri
         [R] [LI]               [LI]                    [PH]                      [PH]
     [E1]         [LI]    [E2]        [LI-DM]       [E3]                     [DM]
                                                                              [E4-BU]

R = Research              E1-E4 = Emails 1-4        LI = LinkedIn action
LI-DM = LinkedIn DM       PH = Phone call           DM = Direct Mail
E4-BU = Break-up email
```

### Sequence B: Warm Approach — Visual Calendar

```
Week 1                    Week 2                    Week 3
Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri       Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri       Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri
[REF][E1]                      [LI]                 [LI/E]
               [E2]       [E3]        [PH]          [E4-BU]

REF = Referral intro       E1-E4 = Emails           LI = LinkedIn
PH = Phone                 E4-BU = Break-up
```

### Key Timing Rules

1. **Minimum 48-hour gap** between any two direct outreach touches (email, DM, phone, direct mail) to the same lead
2. **LinkedIn engagement** (commenting on posts) can happen on any day without counting as a direct touch
3. **Tuesday-Thursday bias**: 70%+ of direct outreach touches should fall on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday
4. **Morning delivery**: Email and LinkedIn DMs sent between 7:00-8:30 AM recipient local time
5. **Phone calls**: 8:00-9:00 AM or 4:00-5:00 PM recipient local time
6. **No touches on the same day** across different direct channels (exception: LinkedIn engagement + one direct channel is acceptable)
7. **Weekend rule**: Zero outreach on weekends. LinkedIn engagement on Sunday evening is acceptable (many executives browse LinkedIn Sunday nights).

---

## 6. CRM Integration Protocol

Every touch, every response, and every sequence position must be tracked in the CRM. Without tracking, multi-channel outreach becomes chaos — you will double-message, miss follow-ups, and lose leads in the gaps between channels.

### Touch Logging Requirements

Every outreach touch is logged with:

| Field | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Lead ID | Unique identifier | LEAD-2026-0142 |
| Date/Time | Timestamp of touch | 2026-02-26 07:15 AM EST |
| Channel | Which channel | Email, LinkedIn DM, Phone, etc. |
| Touch Type | What was done | Cold email #1, Connection request, Voicemail, etc. |
| Sequence | Which sequence | Sequence A: Full Court Press |
| Sequence Position | Where in the sequence | Step 3 of 12 |
| Content Summary | Brief description | "Trigger-specific opener about PUCO rate case. Offered compliance gap analysis." |
| Personalization Tier | Depth level | Tier 3: Hyper-Personalized |
| Response | What happened | Opened (2x), No reply / Replied: "Send more info" / Bounced |
| Response Time | How fast they responded | 4 hours / N/A |
| Next Action | What happens next | Email #2 scheduled for 2026-03-01 |
| Next Action Date | When | 2026-03-01 |

### Sequence Position Tracking

Each lead has a real-time sequence status:

```
Lead: Jane Smith, VP Operations, Ohio Gas Utility Inc.
Score: 87
Active Sequence: Sequence A (Full Court Press)
Current Position: Step 7 of 12 (LinkedIn DM sent Day 10)
Last Touch: LinkedIn DM, 2026-02-24
Next Touch: Email #3 (Diagnostic Offer), 2026-02-28
Response History:
  - Day 1: LinkedIn connection request → Accepted (Day 2)
  - Day 3: Email #1 → Opened 2x, no reply
  - Day 5: LinkedIn comment → She liked your comment
  - Day 7: Email #2 → Opened 1x, no reply
  - Day 10: LinkedIn DM → Read, no reply (yet)
Channel Preference Signal: LinkedIn (accepted quickly, engaged with comment)
Recommended Adjustment: If Email #3 gets no reply, skip phone, send another LinkedIn DM instead
```

### Response Categorization

Every response is categorized into one of five buckets:

1. **Positive:** Interested, wants to talk, requests meeting, asks for proposal, confirms the trigger
2. **Neutral:** Send more info, redirect to someone else, ask questions, need to check with boss
3. **Negative (temporary):** Not now, bad timing, no budget, have a vendor
4. **Negative (permanent):** Not interested, unsubscribe, do not contact
5. **No response:** With sub-categories: not opened, opened but no reply, opened multiple times but no reply

### Automatic Sequence Advancement

The CRM should trigger next actions automatically based on signals:

| Signal | Automatic Action |
|---|---|
| Email opened within 24 hours | Queue next sequence step on schedule |
| Email opened 3+ times same day | Flag for phone call (manual review) |
| Email not opened after 5 days | Trigger subject line resend |
| LinkedIn connection accepted | Advance to Phase 3 engagement |
| Reply received (any channel) | Pause all sequences, alert for manual response |
| Bounce detected | Flag for alternate email research |
| OOO auto-reply detected | Parse return date, reschedule sequence |

### Manual Override Capability

Any automated sequence can be overridden by a human at any time:
- **Pause:** Freeze the sequence at current position. Useful when a lead says "call me next month."
- **Skip:** Skip the next step and advance to the one after. Useful when a channel is clearly not working.
- **Redirect:** Move the lead to a different sequence entirely. Useful when new intelligence changes the approach.
- **Accelerate:** Move the next touch up sooner than scheduled. Useful when a time-sensitive trigger fires.
- **Archive:** Remove the lead from all active sequences. Useful when the opportunity is dead.

## 7. Compliance and Ethics

### CAN-SPAM Compliance (Email)

Every commercial email must include:
1. **Accurate header information:** From name and email must be real and identifiable
2. **Non-deceptive subject line:** Must relate to the email content
3. **Physical mailing address:** Your business address in every email footer
4. **Unsubscribe mechanism:** One-click unsubscribe link in every email
5. **Unsubscribe processing:** Requests honored within 10 business days (best practice: immediately)
6. **Identification as advertisement:** If the email is purely promotional (most cold outreach), it should be identifiable as such

**Enforcement:** Violations carry penalties up to $51,744 per email. Not worth the risk. Comply with every message.

### LinkedIn Terms of Service Compliance

LinkedIn prohibits:
1. **Automated connection requests:** Do not use tools like LinkedHelper, Dux-Soup, or Phantombuster to auto-send connection requests. Manual only.
2. **Automated messaging:** Do not use tools to auto-send DMs or InMails. Manual only.
3. **Scraping profile data:** Do not scrape LinkedIn for contact information (email addresses, phone numbers). Use LinkedIn as a communication channel, not a data source.
4. **Fake profiles:** Do not create fake profiles or use someone else's profile to send outreach.
5. **Excessive connection requests:** LinkedIn may restrict your account if you send too many connection requests that go unaccepted. Keep acceptance rate above 30%. If it drops below, reduce volume and increase personalization.

**Best practice:** Treat LinkedIn as a relationship platform, not an email alternative. Engage genuinely. Build a real professional presence. The best LinkedIn outreach does not feel like outreach at all.

### Do-Not-Contact List Maintenance

Maintain a master suppression list that includes:
1. **Explicit opt-outs:** Anyone who said "unsubscribe," "don't contact me," "remove me," or any variant
2. **Bounced emails:** After 2 bounces from the same address, remove permanently
3. **Competitor employees:** Do not contact employees of direct competitors for intelligence gathering (contacting their clients is acceptable)
4. **Personal relationships:** Contacts where a personal relationship could be damaged by sales outreach (friends, family, social connections where business outreach would be inappropriate)
5. **Previous clients with unresolved issues:** If a past engagement ended poorly, do not add them to automated outreach sequences. Any re-engagement must be personal and direct.

The suppression list is checked before every outreach touch. If a contact appears on the list, they are blocked from all channels. No exceptions.

### Competitive Ethics

**Acceptable:**
- Targeting a competitor's clients with better value propositions
- Monitoring public information about competitor activities (press releases, LinkedIn posts, conference appearances)
- Accepting intelligence voluntarily shared by leads about their current vendor relationships
- Positioning your services as complementary to (not replacement for) existing vendor relationships

**Unacceptable:**
- Contacting competitor employees to extract proprietary information
- Using former competitor employees to access confidential client lists or pricing
- Disparaging competitors by name in outreach or conversations
- Making false claims about competitor capabilities or reliability
- Accessing or using competitor proposals that were shared with you in confidence

### GDPR Considerations (EU-Based Leads)

If any leads in the pipeline are based in the European Union:
1. **Legitimate interest basis:** B2B outreach to professional email addresses can be justified under "legitimate interest" if the message is relevant to their professional role. Document your legitimate interest assessment.
2. **Right to object:** Honor opt-out requests immediately. GDPR gives individuals the right to object to direct marketing at any time.
3. **Data minimization:** Collect and store only the data necessary for outreach (name, title, company, professional email, trigger events). Do not collect personal data (home address, personal email, personal phone) unless voluntarily provided.
4. **Data retention:** Delete lead data for inactive leads after 24 months of no engagement. Do not store data indefinitely "just in case."
5. **Cross-border transfer:** If your CRM is hosted in the US and you have EU lead data, ensure your CRM provider has appropriate data transfer mechanisms (Standard Contractual Clauses or equivalent).

### Record Keeping Requirements

Maintain records of:
