# Market Expansion Protocol

## 1. Purpose

The Ohio energy pipeline is Market #1. It is the proving ground where every agent, template, scoring model, and outreach sequence was built and validated. This protocol is how you launch Market #2, Market #3, and beyond.

The goal is not to start from scratch each time. Every new market launch should be faster and more efficient than the last because you are transferring intelligence, not rebuilding it. The first market took months to build. The second should take weeks. By the fifth market, the launch sequence should be a two-week sprint with predictable outcomes.

This protocol covers:
- How to evaluate whether a market is worth entering
- How to sequence expansion so you don't overextend
- How to run the first 90 days in a new market
- How to transfer intelligence across markets
- How to manage a portfolio of markets simultaneously
- When to exit a market that isn't working

Every section is designed to be executed by the Consultant Lead Agent with minimal manual intervention. The agent runs the same playbook in every market — only the inputs change.

## 2. Market Readiness Assessment Framework

Before committing time and money to a new market, score it on ten factors. Each factor is scored 1-10. Be honest. Optimism kills market entries faster than competition does.

### Scoring Criteria

**Factor 1: Pain Density (1-10)**
How many companies in this market have the problems your packages solve?

- 1-3: Fewer than 10 companies with relevant pain points. Niche market with limited TAM.
- 4-6: 10-50 companies with relevant pain. Enough to build a pipeline but not enough to sustain long-term growth.
- 7-10: 50+ companies with active, recurring pain points. Deep market with compounding opportunity.

Example — Ohio Energy scored 8: AEP, FirstEnergy, Duke Energy Ohio, Ohio Edison, Dominion East Ohio, Columbia Gas, plus dozens of midstream operators, pipeline companies, and generation facilities. Dense pain around interconnection queues, grid modernization, regulatory compliance, and aging infrastructure.

**Factor 2: Trigger Frequency (1-10)**
How often do buying triggers fire in this market?

- 1-3: Triggers fire rarely (once every few years). Long sales cycles with infrequent windows.
- 4-6: Triggers fire quarterly. Enough to maintain pipeline flow but requires patience.
- 7-10: Triggers fire monthly or more. Constant deal flow from regulatory changes, M&A, capital programs, and workforce shifts.

Example — Ohio Energy scored 9: PUCO filings happen monthly. Rate cases cycle every 3 years per utility. M&A activity in midstream is constant. Grid modernization programs create multi-year trigger sequences. ERCOT market changes create ripple effects. Workforce retirements in skilled trades create perpetual staffing gaps.

**Factor 3: Buyer Accessibility (1-10)**
Can you reach decision-makers, or are they behind procurement walls?

- 1-3: Procurement-driven buying. RFP-only culture. No way to reach decision-makers directly.
- 4-6: Mixed. Some buyers are accessible, others require procurement engagement. Relationship-based access is possible but slow.
- 7-10: Decision-makers are accessible via LinkedIn, industry events, and direct outreach. Relationships drive buying decisions.

Example — Ohio Energy scored 7: VP-level buyers at utilities attend OOGA, EEI, and regional conferences. Midstream operators are more accessible (smaller companies, fewer gatekeepers). Large IOUs like AEP have procurement processes but relationship-based access to VPs is achievable through industry connections.

**Factor 4: Competitive Saturation (1-10, inverted — higher is LESS saturated)**
How many established consultants already serve this market?

- 1-3: Dominated by 2-3 large firms with deep relationships and long-term MSAs. Nearly impossible to displace.
- 4-6: Moderate competition. Large firms present but not entrenched. Room for specialists with differentiated offers.
- 7-10: Fragmented. No dominant player. Buyers are underserved or dissatisfied with current options.

Example — Ohio Energy scored 6: Burns & McDonnell, Black & Veatch, and 1898 & Co. are present but focused on large capital projects. The operational consulting space (turnarounds, integration, queue management) is less saturated. Opportunity exists in the gap between large-firm pricing and small-firm capability.

**Factor 5: Existing Relationships (1-10)**
Do you know anyone in this market? Do your referral partners?

- 1-3: No existing relationships. Starting completely cold.
- 4-6: A few contacts from past work or conferences. Enough to get 2-3 warm introductions.
- 7-10: Strong existing network. Multiple former colleagues, active referral partners, and trusted contacts who can open doors.

Example — Ohio Energy scored 8: 15+ years of project execution experience with Ohio utilities. Former colleagues at AEP, FirstEnergy, and multiple contractors. Active relationships with engineering firms, staffing companies, and equipment vendors.

**Factor 6: Geographic Fit (1-10)**
Can you serve this market from your current location?

- 1-3: Requires frequent long-distance travel or relocation. High travel costs eat into margins.
- 4-6: Drivable but far. 3-5 hour drive, occasional flights. Manageable for key meetings but not for ongoing project work without remote capability.
- 7-10: Local or near-local. Within 2-hour drive. Easy to attend events, meet clients, and manage projects without excessive travel overhead.

Example — Ohio Energy scored 9: Based in Ohio. All target companies within 3-hour drive. Most within 90 minutes. Conference attendance is local. Client site visits are same-day trips.

**Factor 7: Revenue Potential (1-10)**
What is the realistic total addressable market for your packages?

- 1-3: Less than $500K total annual opportunity. Not enough to justify dedicated market effort.
- 4-6: $500K-$2M total annual opportunity. Enough to sustain one consultant but limited growth ceiling.
- 7-10: $2M+ total annual opportunity. Room for multiple concurrent engagements and multi-year growth.

Example — Ohio Energy scored 7: 20+ target companies, average engagement value $75K-$250K, 2-4 engagements per year at maturity equals $300K-$1M annual revenue from this market alone. Growth potential with M&A-driven integration work and regulatory compliance cycles.

**Factor 8: Regulatory Tailwinds (1-10)**
Are regulations creating mandatory demand for your services?

- 1-3: No regulatory pressure. All demand is discretionary and budget-dependent.
- 4-6: Some regulatory drivers but not urgent. Compliance timelines measured in years.
- 7-10: Active regulatory mandates creating urgent, non-discretionary demand. Companies must act or face penalties.

Example — Ohio Energy scored 8: FERC Order 2023 (interconnection reform), EPA emissions rules, PUCO rate case requirements, Ohio SB 52 renewable siting rules, NERC reliability standards — all creating mandatory compliance work that utilities cannot defer.

**Factor 9: Referenceable Work (1-10)**
Do you have case studies or experience that translate to this market?

- 1-3: No relevant experience. Would need to build credibility from scratch.
- 4-6: Adjacent experience that requires explanation to map to this market. Credible but not compelling.
- 7-10: Direct, relevant experience with quantified results. Case studies that make buyers say "you've done exactly this before."

Example — Ohio Energy scored 9: Direct experience managing utility turnarounds, interconnection queue backlogs, post-acquisition integrations, and capital project execution in Ohio energy. Quantified results available.

**Factor 10: Speed to First Deal (1-10)**
How quickly could you close a deal in this market?

- 1-3: 12+ months to first deal. Long procurement cycles, relationship-building required, RFP timelines.
- 4-6: 6-12 months. Warm introductions needed, moderate procurement process.
- 7-10: Under 6 months. Active triggers, accessible buyers, warm intro paths available.

Example — Ohio Energy scored 7: First deal achievable in 3-6 months with warm introductions and active triggers. Diagnostic-first approach lowers the commitment barrier and accelerates entry.

### Scoring Summary

| Factor | Score |
|--------|-------|

### Decision Thresholds

- **70-100: Strong Enter Signal.** Market is ready. Begin the 90-day launch protocol immediately. Allocate full market entry resources.
- **50-69: Conditional Enter.** Market has potential but specific conditions must be met first. Identify the 2-3 lowest-scoring factors and define what would need to change before entry. Revisit in 90 days.
- **Below 50: Do Not Enter Yet.** Market is not viable with current resources and positioning. Archive the assessment and revisit annually or when conditions change.

Ohio Energy reference score: 78/100. Strong enter. This is the baseline for comparison.

## 3. Market Entry Sequencing — Which Market Next

### The Adjacency Model

Expand outward from your proven market in concentric rings. Each ring increases distance (geographic or industry) from your core. Never skip a ring.

**Ring 1 — Same Industry, Adjacent Geography**
Closest adjacency. Same buyers, same triggers, same packages. Only the companies and geography change.

- Pennsylvania energy (Appalachian basin overlap, same midstream operators, similar regulatory environment via PA PUC)
- West Virginia energy (pipeline infrastructure, gas processing, Appalachian ties)
- Kentucky energy (coal-to-gas transition, LG&E/KU, East Kentucky Power)

Why Ring 1 first: Your case studies translate directly. Your industry language is the same. Your referral partners may already have relationships here. Conference circuits overlap. Regulatory patterns are similar (PJM interconnection for PA, same FERC requirements).

**Ring 2 — Adjacent Industry, Same Geography**
Stay in Ohio but apply your operational consulting expertise to industries with similar pain points.

- Ohio industrial manufacturing (automotive supply chain, steel, chemical processing)
- Ohio chemical and refining (Marathon, BP-Husky, INEOS)
- Ohio construction and heavy civil (transportation, water infrastructure)

Why Ring 2 second: You keep your geographic advantage. Your project management and turnaround expertise translates. The buyer persona (VP Operations, Plant Manager) behaves similarly. But you need to learn new industry jargon, different regulatory drivers, and different competitive landscapes.

**Ring 3 — Same Industry, Distant Geography**
Take your energy expertise to geographies beyond driving distance.

- Texas energy (ERCOT market, upstream/midstream, different regulatory environment)
- Gulf Coast energy (Louisiana, Mississippi — LNG, petrochemical, refining)
- Rocky Mountain energy (Colorado, Wyoming — pipeline, extraction)

Why Ring 3 third: Your industry expertise transfers but your geographic advantage disappears. You need local partners, different travel logistics, and market-specific regulatory knowledge. Your Ohio case studies still resonate but you are competing against local firms with established relationships.

**Ring 4 — Adjacent Industry, Different Geography**
Maximum stretch without going fully new.

- Texas manufacturing (semiconductor fabs, defense, aerospace)
- National pipeline construction (cross-state projects, FERC-jurisdictional)

Why Ring 4 fourth: You are combining industry learning with geographic learning simultaneously. This only works when you have strong playbooks from Ring 1-3 markets and robust agent infrastructure to manage multiple fronts.

**Ring 5 — New Industry Entirely**
Completely new territory.

- Data centers (power, cooling, construction management)
- Healthcare facilities (capital projects, regulatory compliance)
- Government/DOD (federal contracting, facility management)

Why Ring 5 last: Different buyers, different procurement (often RFP-driven), different competitive dynamics, different compliance requirements. Only enter here when your agent system is mature enough to handle the learning curve without disrupting existing markets.

### The Sequencing Rule

Never skip a ring. If you jump from Ring 1 to Ring 3, you miss the learning that Ring 2 provides (applying your expertise to adjacent industries). If you jump from Ring 1 to Ring 5, you are starting over with none of the adjacency advantages.

The one exception: If a specific opportunity presents itself (an inbound lead, a referral, a conference conversation), you can pursue it regardless of ring. But pursuing a single opportunistic deal is different from committing to a market entry. Don't confuse a one-off project with a strategic expansion.

### Concrete Expansion Roadmap

**Year 1 (Current): Ohio Energy**
- Build the playbook
- Close first 3-5 deals
- Validate packages and pricing
- Establish referral partner network
- Document everything the agent needs for replication

**Year 1-2: Pennsylvania/West Virginia Energy (Ring 1)**
- Leverage Appalachian basin overlap
- Target midstream operators with PA/WV operations
- Attend PIOGA (Pennsylvania Independent Oil & Gas Association) events
- Adapt trigger watchlist for PA PUC and WV PSC filings
- Goal: 2-3 deals in first 12 months

**Year 2: Ohio Industrial/Chemical (Ring 2)**
- Leverage geographic advantage and operational consulting expertise
- Target large manufacturers and chemical facilities with turnaround and integration needs
- Join Ohio Manufacturers' Association and Ohio Chemistry Technology Council
- Adapt packages for manufacturing context (same structure, different language)
- Goal: 2 deals in first 12 months

**Year 2-3: Texas Energy (Ring 3)**
- Leverage energy industry expertise in the largest US energy market
- Identify local referral partners (this is critical — you need boots on the ground)
- Attend Texas conferences (TIPRO, Texas Pipeline Association, GCPA)
- Adapt for ERCOT market dynamics, Railroad Commission of Texas regulation
- Goal: 1-2 deals in first 12 months (longer ramp due to geographic distance)

**Year 3+: Evaluate based on data**
- Which markets are producing the best pipeline-to-revenue conversion?
- Where are referral patterns pointing?
- Where is inbound interest emerging?
- Let the data drive expansion decisions, not assumptions

### Days 31-60: First Outreach Cycle

**Week 5-6 Tasks:**
- Launch outreach to top 10 targets (email + LinkedIn + referral intro, staggered over 2 weeks)
- Send first outreach email to each target with trigger-specific angle
- Follow up on LinkedIn with personalized connection request referencing the trigger
- Ask referral partners for warm introductions to specific targets
- Track every touchpoint in the pipeline tracker

**Week 7-8 Tasks:**
- Send follow-up emails to non-responders (new angle, not a "just checking in" message)
- Attend first industry event in the new market
- At the event: meet 5+ target buyers, collect business cards, schedule follow-up conversations
- Evaluate response rates and adjust outreach angles if below 10% response rate
- Run weekly trigger refresh and add new targets as triggers fire
- Begin second outreach batch prep (targets 11-20)

**Deliverable:** First outreach cycle complete. Response rates tracked. Event attendance completed. Pipeline status documented.

### Days 61-90: Assessment

**Week 9-10 Tasks:**
- Launch second outreach batch (targets 11-20)
- Follow up on all event connections within 48 hours of event
- Conduct any scheduled meetings (diagnostic presentations, introductory calls)
- Track pipeline progression: how many leads moved from Outreach to Meeting to Diagnostic?
- Create second piece of market-specific content

**Week 11-12 Tasks:**
- Compile 90-day performance data
- Compare to Market #1 performance at the same stage
- Document competitive intelligence gathered
- Document buyer feedback on positioning and packages
- Make go/no-go decision

### Go/No-Go Decision Criteria (Day 90)

**GO — Continue Full Investment:**
- 3+ meetings held with qualified buyers
- 1+ proposals or diagnostics in pipeline
- Response rate within 50% of Market #1 baseline
- At least 1 referral partner actively engaged
- No insurmountable competitive barriers identified

Action: Continue with full market investment. Set 6-month targets. Allocate ongoing resources.

**CONDITIONAL — Adjust and Continue:**
- 1-2 meetings held
- Response rates below Market #1 baseline but not zero
- Some positive buyer feedback but positioning needs adjustment
- Competitive dynamics harder than expected

Action: Adjust outreach angles based on feedback. Extend assessment period by 60 days. Reduce resource allocation to maintenance level. Re-evaluate at Day 150.

**PAUSE — Step Back and Reassess:**
- 0 meetings held despite full outreach effort
- Response rates below 3% across all channels
- Hostile competitive environment (incumbents with exclusive MSAs, procurement walls)
- Buyer feedback indicates poor product-market fit

Action: Pause active outreach. Maintain passive monitoring (quarterly trigger check). Keep LinkedIn connections active. Archive market intelligence. Re-evaluate in 6 months or when market conditions change.

---

## 5. Cross-Market Intelligence Transfer

### What Transfers Between Markets

**Trigger Patterns:**
Buying triggers in one market often predict triggers in adjacent markets. M&A waves in Ohio energy foreshadow M&A in Pennsylvania energy. Regulatory changes at the federal level (FERC orders, EPA rules) hit all state markets. Technology adoption curves (grid modernization, SCADA upgrades, renewable integration) follow predictable geographic patterns.

Transfer protocol: When a trigger fires in one market, check if the same trigger applies to targets in other markets. FERC Order 2023 affects every utility with an interconnection queue — not just Ohio utilities. An M&A trend in midstream affects every Appalachian basin operator, not just Ohio operators.

**Outreach Effectiveness:**
Which email subject lines get opened? Which outreach angles generate responses? Which LinkedIn message formats lead to connections? These patterns transfer across markets with minor adjustments.

Transfer protocol: Maintain a cross-market outreach effectiveness log. Track open rates, response rates, and meeting conversion rates by outreach angle and market. When an angle works in one market, test it in others. When an angle fails everywhere, kill it.

**Pricing Intelligence:**
What buyers pay in one market informs pricing in adjacent markets. If Ohio utilities pay $25K for a diagnostic, Pennsylvania utilities in the same size range will likely pay within 20% of that number. If Texas operators push back on Phase 2 pricing, it may indicate that your pricing is above market norms for that geography.

Transfer protocol: Track proposal win/loss data by market, package, and price point. Build a pricing database that shows what the market will bear by geography and company size.

**Competitive Dynamics:**
The same competitors appear across adjacent markets. Burns & McDonnell, Black & Veatch, and 1898 & Co. operate nationally. Understanding their positioning, pricing, and weaknesses in one market prepares you for encounters in others. But regional competitors also exist — firms that dominate one state but have no presence elsewhere.

Transfer protocol: Maintain a competitive intelligence database organized by competitor, not by market. Track each competitor's wins, losses, pricing, strengths, and weaknesses across all markets.

**Buyer Persona Variations:**
VP Operations at an Ohio utility behaves differently than VP Operations at a Texas midstream operator. The title is the same but the pain points, decision-making process, and competitive alternatives differ. Understanding these variations prevents you from applying an Ohio playbook to a Texas buyer without adaptation.

Transfer protocol: Document buyer persona variations by market. What matters most to buyers in each geography? What language resonates? What objections come up? Update persona profiles after every sales conversation.

### Cross-Market Intelligence Sharing Cadence

**Monthly: Cross-Market Trigger Summary**
- Which triggers fired across all active markets this month?
- Are patterns emerging? (Is M&A activity increasing across all energy markets? Are multiple states filing new renewable interconnection rules?)
- Which triggers should be added to watchlists in other markets?

**Quarterly: Cross-Market Performance Comparison**
- Pipeline size by market (leads, meetings, proposals, deals)
- Response rates by market and channel
- Revenue by market
- Which market is healthiest? Which is struggling?
- Resource reallocation recommendations

**Annually: Portfolio Strategy Review**
- Which markets to grow (increase investment)
- Which markets to maintain (steady state)
- Which markets to harvest (collect remaining revenue, reduce investment)
- Which markets to exit (stop active pursuit)
- Which new markets to evaluate for entry

## 6. Market-Specific Customization Requirements

### What You MUST Customize for Each Market

**Trigger Watchlist Queries:**
Every market has different companies, regulatory bodies, and trigger sources. Ohio triggers come from PUCO filings and OOGA news. Pennsylvania triggers come from PA PUC and PIOGA. Texas triggers come from the Railroad Commission of Texas and ERCOT. You cannot use the same queries — you must adapt every search string to the new market's companies, regulators, and industry publications.

**Company Monitoring URLs:**
Each target company has different IR pages, SEC filings, press release feeds, and regulatory submissions. The monitoring infrastructure from SKILL.md Step 2 must be rebuilt for every market's target companies.

**Packaged Offer Descriptions:**
The six packages (diagnostic, integration sprint, turnaround readiness, etc.) keep the same structure but need different industry language. An interconnection queue diagnostic for an Ohio utility uses different terminology than a pipeline integrity program diagnostic for a Texas midstream operator. Same deliverables, different words.

**Outreach Language:**
Industry jargon differs. Ohio energy buyers talk about "PUCO compliance" and "ESP filings." Texas energy buyers talk about "Railroad Commission permits" and "ERCOT protocols." Pennsylvania buyers talk about "Act 13 impact fees" and "PJM capacity auctions." Your outreach must use the language of the market, not the language of your home market.

**Competitive Landscape:**
Different competitors dominate in each geography. Burns & McDonnell is strong in the Midwest and Great Plains. Quanta Services dominates in Texas. Willbros or Primoris may be the name to beat in the Gulf Coast. Your competitive positioning must address the actual competitors the buyer is comparing you to, not the competitors from your home market.

**Compliance Considerations:**
Different states have different procurement rules, licensing requirements, and contractual norms. Some states require specific professional licenses for consulting work. Some utilities have mandatory vendor registration processes. Some markets have prevailing wage requirements, minority business participation goals, or state-specific bonding requirements.

### What You Do NOT Customize (Keep Standardized)

**Lead Scoring Model:**
Same formula everywhere. Trigger Strength (0-30) + Company Fit (0-25) + Relationship Proximity (0-25) + Timing (0-20) = Total Score (0-100). The inputs change by market. The formula does not.

**Pipeline Stages:**
Same stages everywhere. Identified > Researched > Outreach > Meeting > Diagnostic > Proposal > Negotiation > Won/Lost. Same definitions, same conversion tracking, same reporting.

**Revenue Tracking Model:**
Same metrics everywhere. Weighted pipeline value, average deal size, conversion rates by stage, time-to-close by stage, revenue per market, revenue per package.

**Win/Loss Analysis Protocol:**
Same questions after every deal outcome. Why did we win/lose? Who was the competition? What was the deciding factor? What would we do differently? Documented in the same format regardless of market.

**Agent Architecture:**
The Consultant Lead Agent runs the same SKILL.md in every market. Same agents, same steps, same templates. Only the data inputs change. This is the core principle that makes scaling possible.

### Portfolio Health Indicators

Each market is scored on a 1-5 star scale based on:

| Stars | Label | Criteria |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 5 | Mature | Steady deal flow. 3+ deals closed. Pipeline replenishes naturally. |
| 4 | Growing | 1-2 deals closed. Pipeline building. Response rates healthy. |
| 3 | Active | Meetings happening. No deals yet. Positive trajectory. |
| 2 | Early | Outreach phase. Few responses. Still evaluating product-market fit. |
| 1 | Launched | Intelligence phase. No outreach yet. Building foundation. |

Markets that drop below 2 stars after 6 months should be evaluated against exit criteria (Section 8).

### Portfolio Rebalancing

When you have 3+ active markets, resource allocation becomes the critical decision. Time spent in one market is time not spent in another.

Allocation guidelines:
- Mature markets (4-5 stars): 20% of time. Maintenance mode. Execute on existing pipeline. Let the agent run.
- Growing markets (3 stars): 40% of time. Active investment. Push for deal closures. Build referral network.
- Early markets (1-2 stars): 40% of time. Intensive building. Intelligence, outreach, event attendance.

When a growing market reaches maturity, shift its time allocation to the next early-stage market. The goal is always one mature market funding the investment in two growing markets.

## 8. Market Exit Criteria

Not every market will work. Knowing when to exit is as important as knowing when to enter. Sunk cost bias kills consulting firms — they keep investing in dead markets because they already spent money there.

### Exit Triggers

**Trigger 1: 12+ months with zero closed deals**
If you have been actively pursuing a market for a full year with consistent outreach, event attendance, and referral partner engagement and have not closed a single deal, the market is not viable for you right now. This does not mean the market is bad — it means your positioning, pricing, relationships, or timing are wrong for this market at this moment.

**Trigger 2: Response rates consistently below 3%**
If fewer than 3 out of every 100 outreach attempts generate any response (reply, meeting request, referral), your message is not resonating. You have tried multiple angles, multiple channels, and multiple segments within the market. Nothing is working.

**Trigger 3: Hostile competitive environment**
Established incumbents with exclusive MSAs (Master Service Agreements), preferred vendor lists, or multi-year contracts that lock out new entrants. Buyers who want to work with you but "can't because of the MSA." This is a structural barrier, not a messaging problem.

**Trigger 4: Market shrinking**
The industry in this geography is consolidating (fewer target companies), shutting down (regulatory shutdown, technology disruption), or migrating (companies moving operations to other states). The addressable market is getting smaller, not bigger.

**Trigger 5: Opportunity cost too high**
The time you spend in this market would produce more revenue if invested in a higher-performing market. Even if this market is showing some traction, the marginal return on time is lower than the marginal return in another market.

### Exit Protocol

**Step 1: Archive all market intelligence**
Do not delete anything. Every company profile, trigger log, competitive analysis, and outreach record should be archived in a market-specific folder. Markets change. What is hostile today may be open in 3 years. Your intelligence will be valuable if you re-enter.

**Step 2: Maintain passive monitoring**
Set up a quarterly check on the market. Run the trigger watchlist queries once per quarter. Check for major changes (new regulations, M&A activity, competitive exits) that might re-open the market. This costs almost nothing and preserves optionality.

**Step 3: Keep relationships alive**
Do not ghost your contacts in this market. Maintain LinkedIn connections. Engage with their content occasionally. Send a relevant article once or twice a year. These relationships may lead to opportunities in other markets or may become valuable if you re-enter this market later.

**Step 4: Document lessons learned**
Write a one-page post-mortem: Why did this market not work? What would need to change for it to work in the future? What did you learn that applies to other markets? File this with the archived intelligence.

**Step 5: Reallocate resources**
Shift the time and budget from the exited market to the highest-potential growing market in your portfolio. Increase outreach volume, event attendance, or referral partner development in the market that is working.

## 9. Scaling Infrastructure

### Stage 1: Solo Consultant (1-2 Markets)

**What you have:**
- Claude Code running the Consultant Lead Agent
- Spreadsheets or markdown files for pipeline tracking
- LinkedIn (free or Premium) for outreach and research
- Google Alerts for basic trigger monitoring
- Manual email outreach

**What you need:**
- Disciplined weekly cadence (trigger refresh, outreach batch, follow-up cycle)
- 5-10 hours per week dedicated to pipeline work
- One market fully mature before launching a second

**Bottleneck:** Your time. You are the researcher, the outreach writer, the meeting taker, the proposal writer, and the project deliverer. Pipeline work competes with delivery work. The agent helps by automating research and writing, but you still execute.

### Stage 2: Scale-Up (3-4 Markets)

**What you need to add:**
- CRM (HubSpot free tier or Salesforce Essentials): Track all leads, touchpoints, and pipeline stages in one place instead of spreadsheets. Automate follow-up reminders.
- Marketing automation (ActiveCampaign or Mailchimp): Automate outreach sequences. Set up drip campaigns for leads that are not ready to buy yet. Track open/click rates across markets.
- LinkedIn Sales Navigator: Advanced search for target buyers. InMail for direct outreach. Lead lists and alerts.
- Virtual assistant or BD coordinator (part-time): Someone to handle research tasks, data entry, event registration, and meeting scheduling so you focus on selling and delivering.

**What changes:**
- Pipeline meetings become weekly standup reviews (even if just you reviewing your own pipeline)
- Cross-market reporting becomes necessary (which market gets more investment this quarter?)
- Outreach volume increases from manual personalization to semi-automated sequences with personalized hooks
- Content creation becomes systematic (one article per month per market, repurposed across channels)

**Bottleneck:** Systems. Without a CRM, you will lose track of leads. Without automation, you cannot maintain outreach volume across 3-4 markets. Without a coordinator, low-value tasks eat your selling time.

### Stage 3: Enterprise (5+ Markets)

**What you need to add:**
- Full sales ops support: Dedicated CRM admin, reporting dashboards, data quality management
- BD team: At least one full-time business development representative per 2-3 markets
- Market-specific BD reps: Reps who live in the geography they serve (a Texas-based rep for the Texas market)
- Marketing support: Content writer, social media management, event coordination
- Proposal team: Proposal writer and graphic designer for high-volume proposal production
- Advanced analytics: Pipeline forecasting, win/loss analysis, market performance comparison

**What changes:**
- You become the strategist, not the executor. Your role is market selection, relationship development at the executive level, and quality control.
- The Consultant Lead Agent becomes the intelligence backbone feeding data to a human sales team.
- Compensation structures need to include BD rep commissions and referral fees.
- Markets are assigned to specific reps with targets and accountability.

**Bottleneck:** Talent. Finding BD reps who understand your industry, your packages, and your consultative selling approach is the hardest part. Hiring too fast produces bad leads and damaged relationships. Hiring too slow limits growth.
