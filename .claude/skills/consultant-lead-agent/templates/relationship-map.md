# Relationship Map Template

## 1. Purpose

Cold outreach converts at 3-5%. Warm intro outreach converts at 15-25%. That is a 5x difference in conversion rate from a single variable: whether the buyer knows who you are before you contact them.

This template systematically maps every possible warm introduction path for every lead in the pipeline. The question is not "who do I know?" — it is "who do I know who knows someone who knows the buyer?" Most consultants stop at the first question. They check their contact list, see nobody from the target company, and send a cold email. The warm path usually exists — it just requires a second or third hop to find.

For every lead in the top 20 pipeline, this template documents:
- Direct connections (you know someone at the target company)
- Indirect connections (you know someone who knows someone)
- Strategic connections (your professional network overlaps with the target through referral partners, associations, or shared contacts)
- The recommended intro path (the highest-probability route to the buyer)
- The specific ask (what to say to the connector)

The relationship map is a living document. It updates every time you attend an event, close a deal, add a LinkedIn connection, or develop a referral partner. A relationship map that was empty three months ago may have warm paths today because your network grew.

---

## 2. Relationship Mapping Framework

For every lead in the top 20 pipeline, work through these three layers systematically. Do not skip layers. The warm path is often hiding in the layer you didn't check.

### Layer 1: Direct Connections (1 Hop)

You know someone who currently works at the target company, or the target buyer themselves.

Questions to answer:
- Do you personally know anyone who works at this company right now? Check LinkedIn connections, email contacts, phone contacts, conference attendee lists.
- Have you ever worked with anyone who now works at this company? Former colleagues, former clients, former project team members who have changed jobs.
- Did you meet anyone from this company at an industry conference, association meeting, or community event? Check business card collections, event contact lists, conference app connections.
- Are any of your close LinkedIn connections (Level 4-5 strength) connected to the target buyer? Use LinkedIn's mutual connection feature to check.
- Has anyone from this company ever engaged with your content (liked, commented, shared a LinkedIn post)?

Where to search:
- LinkedIn: Search your connections who work at [Target Company]. Search mutual connections with [Target Buyer].
- Email: Search your sent mail for the company domain (@targetcompany.com).
- Conference records: Search attendee lists from the last 3 years of industry events.
- CRM/pipeline notes: Check past lead records — did this company appear in a prior pipeline cycle?
- Phone contacts: Search by company name.

### Layer 2: Indirect Connections (2 Hops)

You know someone who knows someone at the target company. This is the most common warm path and the most often overlooked.

Questions to answer:
- Who do you know who has worked with this company as a vendor, consultant, supplier, or contractor? Your engineering firm contacts, equipment vendors, environmental consultants, or staffing firm contacts may serve this company.
- Who in your network is in the same industry association chapter as the target buyer? OOGA, PIOGA, AGA, EEI membership overlaps create natural introduction opportunities.
- Who do you know who went to the same university as the target buyer? Alumni networks are surprisingly effective introduction channels, especially for executive-level buyers.
- Who do you know who previously worked at this company? Former employees who left on good terms are excellent connectors because they know the culture, the org chart, and the decision-making process.
- Do any of your current clients have a business relationship with the target company? (Supplier, customer, joint venture partner, co-member of an industry consortium.)

Where to search:
- LinkedIn: Check your contacts' employer history for the target company. Search your contacts' connections for the target buyer.
- Referral partners: Ask each active referral partner directly: "Do you do any work with [Target Company]?"
- Industry associations: Check committee membership lists for overlaps.
- Alumni directories: If you know the target buyer's alma mater, check for mutual connections.

### Layer 3: Strategic Connections (3 Hops)

Your professional ecosystem overlaps with the target through referral partners, board members, or shared institutional connections. These are weaker ties but still far better than cold outreach.

Questions to answer:
- Which of your referral partners (engineering firms, environmental consultants, legal counsel, financial advisors, staffing firms) serves this company as a client?
- Does your accountant, attorney, banker, or insurance broker have a professional relationship with anyone at this company?
- Does any board member of your current or past clients serve on the board of the target company? Board-level connections create immediate credibility.
- Is the target buyer involved in any community organizations, nonprofit boards, or civic groups where you or your contacts also participate?
- Does the target company participate in any industry research programs (EPRI, GTI Energy, university research partnerships) where you have contacts?

Where to search:
- Board member lists: Check annual reports and proxy statements of your clients and the target company for overlapping board members.
- Professional association leadership: Check board and committee leadership lists for names you recognize.
- Community organizations: Check nonprofit boards, economic development organizations, chambers of commerce.
- Ask directly: Ask your referral partners, attorney, accountant, and banker: "Do you have any relationship with [Target Company]?"

## 3. Relationship Strength Scoring

Not all connections are equal. A connection's value depends on the strength of the relationship — both your relationship with the connector and the connector's relationship with the target buyer.

| Level | Label | Description | Intro Conversion Rate | Characteristics |
|:-----:|-------|-------------|:---------------------:|-----------------|
| 5 | Close personal | Someone who trusts you completely and will vouch for you without hesitation | 60%+ | Former coworker you worked with daily. Close mentor or mentee. Personal friend who happens to know the buyer. They would take your call at 9pm on a Sunday. |
| 4 | Professional trust | Active professional relationship with demonstrated trust | 40-60% | Current client who is happy with your work. Active referral partner who has sent you business. Former colleague you stay in regular contact with. They respond to your emails within 24 hours. |
| 3 | Positive acquaintance | You have met and had a substantive conversation. Positive impression exists. | 25-40% | Met at a conference and had a 20-minute conversation. Connected on LinkedIn with some message exchange. Participated in the same association committee. They would remember your name if you called. |
| 2 | Connected but distant | You are connected (LinkedIn, email list, shared group) but have no real relationship | 10-25% | LinkedIn connection you have never messaged. Attended the same conference but did not interact. On the same industry mailing list. They might recognize your name. |
| 1 | Exists but no relationship | You know of them. They do not know you. Name recognition only. | 5-10% | You follow them on LinkedIn. You have read their published articles. You know their reputation in the industry. They have no idea who you are. |

### Using the Score

- **Level 5-4:** Ask for the introduction directly. These people will say yes. Make it easy for them (write the intro email for them to forward).
- **Level 3:** Ask carefully. Remind them of your connection context before requesting the intro. Frame it as a professional favor, not a sales request.
- **Level 2:** Do NOT ask for an introduction yet. Strengthen the relationship first. Engage with their content. Send them something valuable. Have a real conversation before asking for anything.
- **Level 1:** Do NOT contact for introductions. Build to Level 2 first by creating multiple positive touchpoints over 4-6 weeks.

## 4. Introduction Request Protocol

How to ask for an introduction without being awkward, presumptuous, or transactional.

### For Level 5 Connections (Close Personal)

```
Subject: Quick intro request — [Target Company]

Hey [Name],

I noticed [Target Company] is [trigger event — e.g., "dealing with
a massive interconnection queue backlog after the FERC 2023 changes"].
That's exactly the kind of problem I help companies solve — we just
finished a similar project with [anonymized reference] and cut their
processing time by 60%.

Do you know anyone at [Target Company]? If you're comfortable making
an intro, I'd really appreciate it. Happy to write up a short blurb
you can forward so it's zero effort on your end.

And as always — let me know if there's anyone I can introduce YOU to.

[Your name]
```

### For Level 4 Connections (Professional Trust)

```
Subject: Hoping you might know someone at [Target Company]

[Name],

Hope things are going well on your end. I wanted to reach out because
I'm working on a project that touches on [Target Company]'s world.

They recently [trigger event], and we have deep experience helping
organizations navigate exactly that situation. I'm trying to connect
with [Target Buyer Name or Title] to see if there's a fit.

Would you happen to know anyone there? If so, I'd be grateful for
an introduction. I've attached a short note below that you could
forward if that's easier.

Either way, thanks for considering it. And please don't hesitate
if there's ever anyone I can connect you with.

Best,
[Your name]

--- Forwardable note below ---

[Target Buyer First Name],

I'm [Your Name], and I help [type of company] with [specific
capability]. [Connector Name] suggested I reach out because
[one sentence about why this is relevant to them].

Would you be open to a 15-minute conversation to see if there's
a fit? I'm happy to work around your schedule.

Best,
[Your Name]
[Contact info]
```

### For Level 3 Connections (Positive Acquaintance)

```
Subject: Great to reconnect — quick question

[Name],

It was great connecting at [event/context where you met]. I've been
following your work on [something specific they've done] — impressive
results.

I'm expanding my consulting work into [market or specific area], and
I noticed you're connected to [Target Buyer Name] at [Target Company]
on LinkedIn. I don't want to put you in an awkward position, but
would you be comfortable if I mentioned your name when I reach out
to them? I'd keep it light — just a note saying we're acquainted
through [shared context].

If that doesn't feel right, no worries at all. I appreciate you
even considering it.

Best,
[Your name]
```

### Rules for All Introduction Requests

1. **Never ask a Level 1 or 2 connection for an intro.** They don't know you well enough. The introduction will be weak ("some guy I'm connected with on LinkedIn asked me to introduce you") and may actually hurt your credibility.

2. **Always make it easy for the connector.** Write the introduction email for them to forward. They should be able to hit "Forward," add one sentence ("I know this person and can vouch for their work"), and send. If you ask them to write the introduction from scratch, most people will agree and then never do it.

3. **Always offer reciprocity.** "Let me know if there's anyone I can introduce you to." This signals that you view the relationship as bidirectional, not extractive. Even if they never take you up on it, the offer matters.

4. **Follow up with the connector regardless of outcome.** If the intro leads to a meeting, tell the connector. If it leads to a deal, tell the connector (and consider a referral fee or gift). If the buyer never responded, tell the connector that too — they may follow up on their end.

5. **Send a thank-you regardless of outcome.** The connector spent social capital on you. Acknowledge it whether or not it produced a business result.

6. **Never make the connector look bad.** If you get the intro and then send a hard sales pitch, the connector looks like they facilitated a sales call. Keep the initial conversation consultative, not transactional.

## 5. Referral Partner Development

Referral partners are non-competing professionals who serve the same buyers you do. They are the most scalable source of warm introductions because one referral partner can introduce you to multiple buyers across their entire client base.

### Ideal Referral Partner Types for Energy Consulting

| Partner Type | Why They're Valuable | What You Offer Them | Example Firms |
|-------------|---------------------|--------------------|----|
| Engineering firms (design, not execution) | They design projects, you manage execution. Same buyer, different phase. | Project execution leads they can't serve. Feedback on constructability of designs. | [Local/regional engineering firms in your market] |
| Environmental consultants | Different service, same buyer. They handle permits, you handle operations. | Construction and ops leads that need environmental work. Early project intelligence. | [Environmental firms active in your market] |
| Construction/energy law firms | They advise on contracts and regulatory filings. You do the operational work the contracts describe. | Client referrals for legal work on projects you manage. Industry intelligence. | [Law firms with energy/construction practice groups] |
| Financial advisors / M&A advisory | They advise on deals. You execute the post-deal integration. | Integration project leads they can't serve. Operational due diligence support. | [Regional M&A advisory, investment banking firms] |
| Technology vendors | They sell project management software, ERP, SCADA systems. You implement and optimize. | Implementation project leads. Product feedback from real-world usage. | [Relevant software/technology companies] |
| Staffing and recruiting firms | They provide temporary labor and executive search. You manage the work those people do. | Staffing needs from your projects. Intelligence on hiring trends. | [Staffing firms active in energy sector] |
| Insurance brokers / surety companies | They underwrite project risk. You reduce it. | Risk mitigation evidence that helps their underwriting. Project intelligence. | [Insurance brokers with energy/construction books] |

### Referral Partner Tracking

For each active referral partner, maintain this record:

```
Partner Name:              [Company name]
Contact Person:            [Name, title]
Email:                     [Email]
Phone:                     [Phone]
Partner Type:              [Engineering / Environmental / Legal / Financial / Tech / Staffing / Insurance]

Relationship Strength:     [1-5 per scoring model above]
How You Met:               [Conference, mutual client, cold outreach, referral from someone else]
Date Relationship Started: [YYYY-MM-DD]

Value Exchange:
  What you offer them:     [Specific — project leads, introductions, intelligence, subcontract work]
  What they offer you:     [Specific — client introductions, credibility, market intelligence, joint proposals]

Referrals Given:           [Count — referrals you've sent TO them]
Referrals Received:        [Count — referrals you've received FROM them]
Conversion Rate:           [X% — how many of their referrals became meetings/deals]

Connection Cadence:        [Monthly call / Quarterly lunch / Annual review]
Last Contact:              [YYYY-MM-DD]
Next Scheduled Contact:    [YYYY-MM-DD]

Notes:
[Any relevant context — their specialties, their key clients, topics discussed, agreed next steps]
```

### Referral Partner Development Cadence

**Month 1-3: Identify and Initiate**
- Identify 10 potential referral partners across the 7 types listed above
- Reach out to 5 with a coffee or lunch invitation
- First meeting agenda: Learn about their business, share about yours, identify overlap in client base
- Do NOT ask for referrals in the first meeting. Build the relationship first.

**Month 3-6: Establish and Exchange**
- Monthly check-in with 3-5 active partners
- Send them one relevant piece of intelligence per month (trigger event, article, lead they can't serve but you noticed)
- Give before you ask. Send them a referral before requesting one.
- After 2-3 exchanges, formalize the arrangement: "I think we could be really valuable to each other. Want to set up a regular check-in to share leads and intelligence?"

**Month 6-12: Systematize**
- Quarterly review with each active partner: referrals given/received, conversion rates, market intelligence shared
- Annual strategy meeting: Which clients should we target together? Where are the gaps?
- Consider joint proposals for large opportunities where complementary capabilities create a stronger bid

**Ongoing: Maintain and Grow**
- Never let a referral partner relationship go cold. Even if referral volume is low, maintain the connection.
- Celebrate wins together. When a referral converts to a deal, tell the partner. Buy them dinner. Acknowledge their role.
- Add new partners as you enter new markets. Each market should have 3-5 active referral partners within 12 months of launch.

## 6. Board and Association Network Mapping

Industry associations are the connective tissue of professional networks. Board members and committee leaders are the most connected people in any industry. Mapping these networks reveals warm paths that individual contact searches miss.

### Key Associations for Ohio Energy Market

| Association | Relevance | Your Involvement | Key Contacts | Events |
|------------|-----------|------------------|--------------|--------|
| OOGA (Ohio Oil & Gas Association) | Direct — oil and gas operators, midstream, service companies | [Member / Committee / Board / None] | [Names of people you know in leadership] | Annual Meeting (Mar), Summer Conference (Jul), Technical Symposium (Oct) |
| AGA (American Gas Association) | Direct — gas distribution utilities, pipeline operators | [Member / Committee / Board / None] | [Names] | Operations Conference (Apr), Financial Forum (May) |
| EEI (Edison Electric Institute) | Direct — investor-owned electric utilities | [Member / Committee / Board / None] | [Names] | Annual Convention (Jun), Transmission Conference (Oct) |
| EPRI (Electric Power Research Institute) | Indirect — research consortium, utility members | [Member / Committee / Board / None] | [Names] | Various technical conferences throughout year |
| JobsOhio | Indirect — economic development, project managers | [Contact / Active / None] | [Names] | Industry-specific events, site selection meetings |
| Ohio Chamber of Commerce | Indirect — energy committee, broad business connections | [Member / Committee / Board / None] | [Names] | Annual Meeting, policy events |
| PMI (Project Management Institute) | Adjacent — professional credibility, project managers across industries | [Member / Chapter Leader / None] | [Names] | Chapter meetings (monthly), regional conferences |
| AACE International (Association for the Advancement of Cost Engineering) | Adjacent — cost engineers, project controls professionals | [Member / Committee / None] | [Names] | Annual Meeting (Jun), technical papers |
| ISA (International Society of Automation) | Adjacent — automation and controls professionals at utilities | [Member / Chapter Leader / None] | [Names] | Chapter meetings, ISA Expo |

### Association Strategy

For each association, define your engagement level:

**Level 1: Passive Member**
You pay dues and receive the newsletter. Minimal value. No warm paths generated.

**Level 2: Active Attendee**
You attend events, meet people, and engage in conversations. Moderate value. Generates Level 2-3 connections.

**Level 3: Committee Participant**
You join a committee (technical committee, events committee, membership committee). High value. Working alongside other professionals on committee projects builds Level 3-4 relationships over time. This is where most warm paths are created.

**Level 4: Committee or Chapter Leader**
You lead a committee or serve as a chapter officer. Very high value. Leadership positions give you a reason to contact anyone in the association. "I'm chairing the technical committee and would love to get your input" is a natural, non-salesy reason to connect with a target buyer.

**Level 5: Board Member**
You serve on the association's board. Maximum value. Board members know every major player in the industry. Board service is a multi-year commitment but creates deep, lasting relationships with the highest-level contacts in your market.

### Recommended Engagement Strategy

Pick 2-3 associations most relevant to your target market. For each:
1. Start at Level 2 (attend 2-3 events in the first year)
2. Move to Level 3 within 12 months (join one committee)
3. Evaluate Level 4 at 18-24 months (volunteer for committee leadership if the fit is right)
4. Consider Level 5 only when you have the time and the association aligns with your long-term market strategy

Do not join 8 associations at Level 1. That is a waste of dues money. Join 2 at Level 3 and build real relationships.

## 8. Relationship Maintenance Cadence

Relationships are assets. Like all assets, they depreciate without maintenance. A Level 5 connection who you haven't spoken to in 2 years is no longer a Level 5. A referral partner who hasn't heard from you in 6 months stops thinking of you when opportunities arise.

### Maintenance Schedule by Relationship Level

**Level 5 — Close Personal (Monthly)**
- Monthly touchpoint: Call, coffee, lunch, or a meaningful email exchange
- Content: Check in on their work, share a relevant lead or piece of intelligence, discuss industry trends
- Reciprocity: Actively look for ways to help them (introductions, leads, advice, referrals)
- Annual: Face-to-face meeting if distance is a factor. Annual review of how you've helped each other.

**Level 4 — Professional Trust (Quarterly)**
- Quarterly touchpoint: Email check-in, phone call, or forward a relevant article with a personal note
- Content: "Saw this and thought of you" — send an article, trigger alert, or lead that's relevant to their work
- Reciprocity: Send a referral at least once per year. Introduce them to someone valuable.
- Semi-annual: Coffee or lunch to maintain the relationship in person.

**Level 3 — Positive Acquaintance (Semi-Annual)**
- Semi-annual touchpoint: Conference follow-up, LinkedIn engagement, or a brief email referencing shared context
- Content: Comment on their LinkedIn posts. Congratulate them on promotions or achievements. Share content relevant to their industry.
- Goal: Maintain recognition and positive association. Keep your name in their mental Rolodex.
- Annual: Attend at least one event where you'll see them and have a conversation.

**Level 2 — Connected but Distant (Annual)**
- Annual touchpoint: Holiday note, birthday congratulations (if you know it), or a congratulatory message on a promotion or achievement
- Content: Light engagement — like or comment on their LinkedIn content 2-3 times per year
- Goal: Maintain the connection. Prevent it from going completely dormant.
- Upgrade strategy: To move from Level 2 to Level 3, you need a meaningful interaction. Find a reason to have a real conversation (ask for their opinion on an industry topic, invite them to an event).

**Level 1 — Exists but No Relationship (Strengthen Before Asking)**
- No introduction requests at this level. Period.
- Engagement strategy: Like or comment on their content 3 times over 6 weeks. Then send a connection request (if not already connected) or a brief message with a genuine question or compliment. Then wait. Build to Level 2 before considering any ask.
- Timeline: Allow 2-3 months to move from Level 1 to Level 2. There are no shortcuts.

### Relationship Depreciation Rules

Relationships lose one level for every period of no contact beyond the recommended cadence:

| Starting Level | Cadence | If No Contact For | Drops To |
|:--------------:|:-------:|:------------------:|:--------:|
| 5 | Monthly | 3+ months | 4 |
| 4 | Quarterly | 6+ months | 3 |
| 3 | Semi-annual | 12+ months | 2 |
| 2 | Annual | 24+ months | 1 |
| 1 | N/A | N/A | Stays at 1 |

A Level 5 connection you haven't spoken to in a year is effectively a Level 3. You cannot ask for a Level 5 favor from a Level 3 relationship. Re-establish the connection first, then make the ask.

### Annual Relationship Audit

Once per year (January or whenever you run an annual planning cycle), audit your relationship map:

1. Review all Level 4-5 connections. Are they still at that level? Have you maintained cadence? Update scores.
2. Identify Level 3 connections that could be upgraded to Level 4 with intentional effort. Pick 5 to invest in this year.
3. Identify Level 2 connections who are connected to high-value targets. These are upgrade priorities.
4. Remove connections that have left the industry, retired, or moved to irrelevant roles. Don't maintain dead connections.
5. Add new connections made in the past year. Score them. Assign maintenance cadence.
6. Review referral partner health. Are all partners active? Are referrals flowing in both directions? Schedule catch-up meetings with any partners you haven't spoken to in 3+ months.

### Relationship Map Health Score

Track overall network health with these metrics:

```
Total Level 5 connections:        [Count]  (Target: 5-10)
Total Level 4 connections:        [Count]  (Target: 15-25)
Total Level 3 connections:        [Count]  (Target: 30-50)
Active referral partners:         [Count]  (Target: 5-10)
Referrals given (past 12 months): [Count]  (Target: 12+)
Referrals received (past 12 months): [Count]  (Target: 6+)
Warm intro paths available for top 20 leads: [Count/20] (Target: 12+/20)
```
