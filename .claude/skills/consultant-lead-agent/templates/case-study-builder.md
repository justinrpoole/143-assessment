# Case Study Builder Template

## 1. Purpose

Every completed engagement is a potential case study. Case studies are the number one trust-building asset in consulting sales. When a VP of Transmission at a utility in Ohio is deciding whether to hire you, the most persuasive thing you can show them is evidence that you solved a similar problem for a similar company with measurable results.

This is not marketing fluff. This is social proof that directly accelerates the sales cycle. Buyers who see a relevant case study before the first meeting are 3x more likely to take that meeting. Buyers who see a relevant case study during the proposal phase are 2x more likely to approve the proposal. The case study does more selling than any email sequence or LinkedIn post ever will.

The problem is that most consulting firms never capture this asset. The engagement ends, the team moves to the next project, and the story dies. Six months later, someone needs a case study for a proposal and has to reconstruct it from memory and old deliverables. The result is weak, generic, and unconvincing.

This template systematizes case study extraction, anonymization, and distribution so that every completed engagement automatically generates a reusable social proof asset within 30 days of completion.

## 2. Case Study Extraction Protocol

### Timing

Begin case study extraction at engagement completion + 30 days. The 30-day buffer serves two purposes:
1. It allows initial outcomes to materialize (you cannot quantify results on the day the project ends)
2. It gives the client time to observe the impact and formulate their own assessment of the value delivered

For longer engagements (6+ months), capture interim results at the midpoint and update with final results at completion + 30 days.

### Data Collection Questionnaire

Complete this questionnaire for every engagement that scores 7+ on client satisfaction.

## 3. Anonymization Protocol

Not every client will allow full attribution. Utilities in particular are sensitive about revealing operational deficiencies publicly. The anonymization protocol provides four levels of privacy, each progressively more opaque.

### Level 1 — Name Removed, Industry and Size Preserved

Example: "A Fortune 500 investor-owned utility in the PJM region"

Use when: The client permits the case study but does not want their company name associated with the specific operational challenge described.

Rules:
- Remove the company name
- Preserve the industry segment, approximate size, and geographic region
- Ensure that the description does not uniquely identify the company. In Ohio, there are only a handful of large investor-owned utilities. "A large investor-owned utility in Ohio" could be narrowed to 3-4 companies. If the case study details further narrow it (specific regulatory filing, specific timeline, specific program name), increase anonymization to Level 2.

### Level 2 — Industry Shifted

Example: "A major energy company in the Midwest"

Use when: Level 1 anonymization still makes the company identifiable due to small market size or unique program details.

Rules:
- Remove the company name
- Broaden the industry descriptor (from "investor-owned utility" to "energy company")
- Broaden the geographic descriptor (from "Ohio" to "Midwest")
- Remove any program names, regulatory filing references, or timeline details that could identify the company
- Preserve the nature of the challenge and the type of solution

### Level 3 — Full Anonymization

Example: "A large industrial company undergoing a complex post-acquisition integration"

Use when: The client does not want any connection to the case study, but the engagement results are too valuable to waste.

Rules:
- Remove all identifying information: name, industry specificity, geography, size details
- Keep only the challenge type and the results
- Generalize the approach description to remove any proprietary or company-specific methodology references
- The case study reads as a generic industry example

### Level 4 — Composite Case Study

Example: A case study that combines elements from 2-3 similar engagements into a single narrative.

Use when: No single client will approve a case study, but you have multiple similar engagements with consistent results.

Rules:
- Combine quantitative results from multiple engagements (use averages or ranges)
- Create a narrative that is truthful in aggregate but does not describe any single client
- Label the case study clearly: "This case study reflects composite results from multiple client engagements."
- Never attribute a composite case study to a single company or use a client quote in a composite

### Anonymization Decision Tree

```
Client approves full attribution?
  ├── YES → Level 0 (Full attribution — name, logo, quote)
  └── NO → Can they be identified from industry + size + geography?
              ├── YES → Level 2 (Industry shifted)
              └── NO → Level 1 (Name removed)
                         └── Still identifiable from program details?
                               ├── YES → Level 3 (Full anonymization)
                               └── NO → Level 1 is sufficient

No single client will approve?
  └── Multiple similar engagements exist?
        ├── YES → Level 4 (Composite)
        └── NO → No case study possible. Document internally only.
```

## 4. Case Study Format

### Full Case Study (800-1200 Words)

This is the definitive version. All other formats are derived from it.

**Structure:**

**Headline:** "[Specific Outcome] for [Company Description]"
- Good: "45% Reduction in Interconnection Study Cycle Time for a Major PJM Utility"
- Bad: "Helping a Utility Improve Processes"
- The headline must contain a specific, quantified outcome. If the case study does not have a quantifiable result, it is not ready to publish.

**The Situation (150 words):**
Context that the reader needs to understand the challenge. Industry dynamics, company situation, market pressures. Written in third person, past tense.

Example: "A major investor-owned utility in the PJM region was experiencing unprecedented growth in its interconnection queue. The volume of generator interconnection requests had increased 40% in 18 months, driven by renewable energy development and data center demand. The utility's interconnection engineering team, staffed at 2018 levels, was struggling to complete feasibility and system impact studies within FERC-mandated timelines. Average study completion time had reached 147 days — 63% above the 90-day target. Developer complaints were escalating, and the state public utilities commission had begun informal inquiries about the delays."

**The Challenge (150 words):**
What made this problem hard. Complexity, constraints, prior failed attempts.

Example: "The challenge was structural, not tactical. The utility's interconnection process had been designed for an era of 20-30 study requests per year. The queue now contained over 150 active requests. The engineering team relied on manual tracking (spreadsheets and email chains), sequential study processes that created bottleneck dependencies, and a facilities cost estimation step that required coordination across three engineering groups with no shared project management. Staffing was 33% below peer benchmarks relative to queue volume. Simply adding headcount would not solve the problem — the underlying process could not scale regardless of team size."

**The Approach (200 words):**
What you did, in phases, with enough specificity to demonstrate expertise but not so much detail that the reader could execute it without you.

**The Results (200 words):**
Quantitative outcomes first, qualitative second. Use specific numbers. Use comparison format (before vs after, actual vs target, client vs peer benchmark).

Example results section structure:
- Primary metric: "Average study completion time reduced from 147 days to 98 days within 6 months — a 33% improvement and within 9% of the FERC 90-day target."
- Secondary metrics: "Staff overtime reduced 42%. Developer satisfaction scores improved from 2.1 to 3.8 on a 5-point scale."
- Financial impact: "The process improvements are projected to save $1.4M annually in labor costs and eliminate an estimated $3.2M in regulatory risk."
- Sustainability: "The governance framework and dashboards deployed during the engagement continue to be used 12 months post-completion."

**Key Insight (100 words):**
One transferable lesson that a reader could apply to their own situation, even if they never hire you.

Example: "The most impactful change was not a technology deployment or a staffing increase — it was converting the facilities cost estimation process from sequential to parallel review. This single change eliminated 42 days of cycle time by allowing three engineering groups to review simultaneously instead of waiting for each other. The lesson applies to any multi-stakeholder process: look for sequential dependencies that could be parallelized before investing in technology or headcount."

**Client Quote (50 words):**
Direct quote from a named stakeholder (or anonymous with title).

**Engagement Details Sidebar:**
Duration | Team Size | Package Used | Diagnostic Entry | Key Metrics | Anonymization Level

### One-Pager (250 Words)

Condensed version for use in proposals, outreach attachments, and conference handouts.

Structure:

```
[HEADLINE WITH QUANTIFIED OUTCOME]

CHALLENGE
[3-4 sentences describing the problem]

APPROACH
[3-4 sentences describing what was done]

RESULTS
  • [Metric 1]: [Before → After]
  • [Metric 2]: [Before → After]
  • [Metric 3]: [Before → After]

"[Client quote — 1-2 sentences]"
— [Name/Title], [Company/Anonymous Description]

[Company Logo or Industry Icon]      [Your Logo]
```

The one-pager fits on a single page when formatted. It should be printable, emailable, and attachable to a proposal without requiring the reader to invest more than 60 seconds.

### Social Proof Snippet (50 Words)

A single sentence or short paragraph that can be dropped into any communication.

Format: "[Company type] [achieved outcome] by [percentage/amount] in [timeframe] using our [package/diagnostic name]."

Examples:
- "A major PJM utility reduced interconnection study cycle time by 33% in 6 months using our Program Management and Controls deployment."
- "A Fortune 500 energy company captured 94% of targeted post-acquisition synergies within 9 months using our Integration Sprint methodology."
- "An Ohio-based generation company reduced turnaround overrun costs by $2.1M in a single cycle using our Turnaround Readiness framework."

Use in: Email signatures, LinkedIn profile "About" section, outreach email bodies, landing page testimonials, proposal executive summaries.

## 5. Case Study Distribution Strategy

Each case study format has specific distribution channels and use cases.

### Full Case Study (800-1200 words)
- Website: Dedicated case studies page, organized by industry and package
- Proposal appendix: Attached to proposals where the case study is directly relevant to the prospect's situation
- Conference handouts: Printed versions for distribution at industry conferences (EEI, EUCI, DistribuTECH, ERCOT stakeholder meetings)
- Speaking opportunity applications: Submitted as evidence of subject matter expertise when applying to speak at industry events
- LinkedIn articles: Adapted and published quarterly (see below)

### One-Pager (250 words)
- Email attachment: Sent to warm leads after the first positive response, before the first meeting
- Proposal insert: Included in the body of the proposal (not just the appendix) when directly relevant
- Conference leave-behind: Handed to prospects met at conferences
- Direct mail insert: Included in high-value direct mail packages to C-suite targets

### Social Proof Snippet (50 words)
- Email signatures: Rotate monthly. "Recently helped [Company type] achieve [outcome]."
- LinkedIn profile: Include 2-3 snippets in the "About" section
- Outreach email body: Embed in personalized outreach. "We recently helped a utility in your region reduce [metric] by [X]%. Happy to share the details."
- Landing pages: Testimonial section with rotating snippets
- Webinar slides: Social proof slide at the beginning and end of presentations

### LinkedIn Article Adaptation

Quarterly, adapt one full case study into a LinkedIn article. The article is not a copy of the case study — it is a thought leadership piece that uses the case study as the evidence.

Structure:
1. Open with a provocative statement about the industry problem (not about you)
2. Describe the problem in terms the audience recognizes
3. Share the approach as a methodology insight (not a sales pitch)
4. Present the results as evidence that the methodology works
5. Close with a transferable insight the reader can use immediately
6. CTA: "If your organization faces a similar challenge, I'd welcome a conversation."

## 6. Case Study Inventory Management

### Case Study Registry

Maintain a living registry of all case studies, their status, and their distribution.

```

```

### Performance Tracking

Track which case studies are being used and how they perform:

| Case Study | Proposal Inclusions (Q) | Email Attachments (Q) | LinkedIn Views | Buyer Mentions (Q) | Impact Score |
|------------|------------------------|-----------------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|
| #1 | 4 | 12 | 850 | 3 | High |
| #2 | 2 | 6 | 420 | 1 | Medium |
| #3 | 5 | 15 | 1200 | 5 | Very High |
| #4 | 1 | 3 | 180 | 0 | Low |
| #5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Not yet distributed |

"Buyer Mentions" is the most important metric. It tracks how many times a buyer references the case study in a sales conversation. "I saw your case study about the turnaround cost reduction — that's exactly our situation." That statement is worth more than 1,000 LinkedIn views.

---

## 7. Permission and Approval Workflow

### Step 1: Internal Review (Days 1-3)

Before sending anything to the client, review internally:
- Does the case study accurately represent the engagement?
- Are the quantitative results defensible? (Can we prove these numbers if challenged?)
- Are there any confidential details that should not be shared regardless of client permission?
- Is the anonymization level appropriate?
- Is the tone appropriate? (Factual, not boastful. Results-focused, not self-congratulatory.)

### Step 2: Client Review Draft (Days 4-14)

Send the case study to the client's primary contact with a 10-business-day review window.

**Permission Request Email Template:**

```
Subject: Case Study Review — [Engagement Name]

[Client Contact Name],

Thank you again for the opportunity to work with [Company] on [engagement description].
As we discussed, we would like to develop a case study based on our engagement to share
with prospective clients facing similar challenges.

Attached is a draft for your review. I want to make sure it accurately represents the
engagement and the results, and that you are comfortable with the level of detail and
attribution.

A few specific questions:
1. Are the results as stated accurate and representative?
2. Is the quote attributed to you acceptable as written?
3. What level of attribution are you comfortable with?
   a. Full attribution (company name, your name and title)
   b. Company name with anonymous quote
   c. Anonymous company with your name and title
   d. Fully anonymous (no company name, no personal name)
4. Are there any details you would like added, removed, or modified?

If I do not hear from you within 10 business days, I will follow up. We will not publish
anything without your written approval.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
```

### Step 3: Client Feedback Incorporation (Days 15-17)

Incorporate all client feedback. If the client requests changes that materially alter the accuracy of the case study (inflating results, removing important context), push back professionally. Accuracy is non-negotiable.

### Step 4: Legal Review (Days 18-22, If Applicable)

If the company name is being used (Level 0 attribution), route through the client's legal or communications department if they require it. Some utilities have formal approval processes for external mentions. Ask during Step 2 whether legal or comms review is required.

### Step 5: Final Approval and Publication (Days 23-25)

Send the final version to the client with a simple approval request:

"Attached is the final version incorporating your feedback. Please confirm approval to publish by replying to this email with 'Approved.' We will not publish until we receive your written confirmation."

Upon approval:
- Publish to website
- Add to case study registry
- Generate one-pager and social proof snippet versions
- Distribute to all active channels
- Add to relevant proposal templates

### Step 6: Revocation Protocol

If a client later requests removal of a published case study:
- Remove from website within 24 hours
- Remove from all active proposal templates within 48 hours
- Remove from any active outreach sequences within 48 hours
- Archive the case study internally (do not delete — it may be re-anonymized and reused)
- Acknowledge the removal in writing to the client
- If the case study was widely distributed (conference handouts, printed materials), note that retrieval of physical copies is not possible but no further distribution will occur

## 8. Case Study Gap Analysis

### Monthly Inventory Review

Every month, review the case study inventory against the six packaged offers and three diagnostics. The goal: at least 3 case studies per package and 2 per diagnostic.

```
CASE STUDY GAP ANALYSIS — [Month Year]

Package                              Available    Target    Gap    Action
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
A — Program Management & Controls        [N]        3       [N]    [Action if gap]
B — Regulatory & Compliance Advisory     [N]        3       [N]    [Action if gap]
C — Vendor & Contract Optimization       [N]        3       [N]    [Action if gap]
D — Workforce & Operational Readiness    [N]        3       [N]    [Action if gap]
E — Technology & Data Strategy           [N]        3       [N]    [Action if gap]
F — Post-Acquisition Integration         [N]        3       [N]    [Action if gap]

Diagnostic                            Available    Target    Gap    Action
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Utility Interconnection Queue Diag       [N]        2       [N]    [Action if gap]
Post-Acquisition Integration Sprint      [N]        2       [N]    [Action if gap]
Turnaround Readiness Assessment          [N]        2       [N]    [Action if gap]
```

### Closing the Gap

When a package has fewer than 2 case studies:

**Priority 1:** Review completed engagements that used this package. Were any overlooked for case study extraction? Complete the extraction questionnaire now, even if the engagement ended months ago.

**Priority 2:** Create an anonymized version (Level 2 or Level 3) from a completed engagement where the client declined full attribution. The results are still real and usable.

**Priority 3:** Create a composite case study (Level 4) combining results from 2-3 similar engagements. Clearly label it as composite.

**Priority 4:** If no completed engagements exist for this package (new offering), prioritize the next engagement of this type for case study extraction. Discuss case study permission during the engagement kickoff, not after completion.

### Industry Segment Coverage

Also track case study coverage by industry segment:

```
Investor-Owned Utilities:       [N] case studies
Municipal/Cooperative Utilities: [N] case studies
Independent Power Producers:     [N] case studies
Midstream/Pipeline:              [N] case studies
Renewable Developers:            [N] case studies
Market Participants (ERCOT/PJM): [N] case studies
```

If pursuing a new industry segment, having zero case studies in that segment is a significant competitive disadvantage. Prioritize a composite case study or a heavily anonymized version from an adjacent segment (a utility case study repositioned for a renewable developer, for example, if the underlying challenge is similar).

### Freshness Review

Case studies older than 24 months should be reviewed for:
- Are the results still relevant? (Regulatory landscape may have changed)
- Is the approach still current? (Methodology may have evolved)
- Are the quantitative results still impressive? (Market benchmarks shift over time)
- Is the client relationship still active? (If the client has since had a negative experience, do not continue using their case study)

Case studies older than 36 months should be retired from active distribution and archived. They can still be referenced internally but should not be the primary evidence presented to new prospects. Buyers want to see recent work.
