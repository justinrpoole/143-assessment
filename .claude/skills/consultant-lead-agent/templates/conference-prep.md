# Conference Prep Template

## 1. Purpose

Every conference is a $5,000-$15,000 investment when you add up registration ($500-$2,500), travel ($500-$1,500), hotel ($600-$2,000), meals and entertainment ($300-$800), and the opportunity cost of 2-4 days away from billable work ($2,000-$8,000). Walking into an event without a plan means you are gambling that investment on luck — hoping the right people show up, hoping you bump into them, hoping the conversation goes somewhere.

This template eliminates the gamble. You walk in knowing exactly who is attending, what they are dealing with, what you want to say, and what outcome you are driving toward. You leave with organized notes, prioritized follow-ups, and a pipeline impact that justifies the investment by a factor of 3x or more.

The preparation takes 4-8 hours spread over 2 weeks before the event. The follow-up takes 2-4 hours in the 48 hours after the event. For a $10,000 total event cost, a single $100K engagement sourced from the event pays for itself 10 times over. But that only happens with preparation.

---

## 2. Event Selection Criteria

Not every conference is worth attending. Before committing time and money, score the event on five factors. Attend only if the total score meets or exceeds the threshold.

### Scoring Matrix

| Factor | Description | Score 1 | Score 3 | Score 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Target Buyer Density** | How many people from your pipeline or ideal client profile will be at this event? | 0-3 known targets | 4-8 known targets | 9+ known targets |
| **Speaker/Content Relevance** | Are the session topics aligned with your packaged offers and expertise areas? | None relevant | 2-3 relevant sessions | 5+ sessions directly aligned with your services |
| **Competitor Presence** | Are competitors attending, sponsoring, or speaking? (Moderate presence = intel opportunity. Dominant presence = hard to stand out.) | Competitors dominate (3+ sponsors) | 1-2 competitors present | No competitors OR you are a sponsor/speaker |
| **Networking Format** | Does the event structure facilitate meaningful conversations? | Large expo only, no structured networking | Some networking sessions, cocktail hours | Structured 1:1 meetings, roundtables, small group sessions |
| **Historical ROI** | If you have attended before, what was the result? If first time, estimate based on peer feedback. | No measurable ROI from past attendance | Generated leads but no closed deals | Directly attributed revenue from past attendance |

### Decision Rule

| Total Score | Decision |
|---|---|
| 20-25 | Attend. High-priority event. Request speaking slot or sponsorship if available. |
| 15-19 | Attend. Standard priority. Focus on pre-scheduled meetings. |
| 10-14 | Consider. Attend only if you can pre-schedule 3+ meetings with qualified targets. If not, skip. |
| Below 10 | Do not attend. Invest the budget elsewhere (direct outreach, content marketing, or a different event). |

### Additional Selection Considerations

- **Geographic proximity:** Ohio/Midwest events are lower cost (drive vs. fly, no hotel needed). This shifts the ROI calculation favorably. A $3,000 local event with a score of 12 may be worth attending. A $12,000 national event with a score of 12 is probably not.
- **Speaking opportunity:** If you can get a speaking slot, the event value increases by 2-3 points automatically. Speaking puts you in front of every attendee, not just the ones you bump into.
- **Sponsorship ROI:** Event sponsorship ($2,000-$15,000) is only worth it if it comes with attendee list access, a speaking slot, or a booth in a high-traffic area. "Logo on the lanyard" sponsorship is not worth it.

I'll be at [Event Name] in [City] on [dates]. I noticed [Company] is working through [trigger event], and I have some relevant experience with [specific capability] that might be worth discussing.

Would 15 minutes for coffee during the event make sense? I'm flexible on timing — happy to work around your schedule.

If there's a better time or format, I'm open to that too. Either way, looking forward to [Event Name].

Best,
[Your Name]"

     The two approaches are complementary / distinct in [specific way].")
```

### Section F: Conversation Playbook

Memorize these frameworks before the event. Do not wing it.

**Opening Lines (choose based on context):**

At a session: "What brought you to this particular session?"
At a reception: "What's been the most useful thing you've heard today?"
At a booth: "Are you evaluating [topic] for your team, or just exploring?"
Cold approach: "I don't think we've met — I'm [Name], I work with [type of companies] on [capability]. What do you do?"

**Active Listening Prompts (to surface pain points):**

- "What's the biggest challenge your team is dealing with right now related to [session topic]?"
- "How are you handling [specific industry challenge]? I'm curious what's working and what isn't."
- "If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about your [function/department], what would it be?"
- "Are you seeing [specific trend] affect your operations? We're hearing a lot about that from other [industry] companies."
- "How did [specific trigger event] affect your team's workload? That kind of thing usually creates downstream pressure on [specific function]."

**Bridge Statements (connecting their pain to your offering):**

Only use these AFTER they have expressed a pain point. Never bridge unprompted.

- "That's exactly the kind of thing our [diagnostic name] was built to address. It specifically looks at [2-3 things they mentioned] and delivers [specific outcome]."
- "We worked with a company in a similar situation last year — [brief 2-sentence case reference]. Happy to share what we learned if it would be useful."
- "That pain point keeps coming up in conversations with other [industry] leaders. We built a [deliverable] specifically for it. Want me to send you the details after the event?"

**Meeting Close (proposing next steps without being salesy):**

- "This has been a great conversation. Can I send you [specific resource] next week? What's the best email for you?"
- "I'd love to continue this conversation without the conference noise. Would a 20-minute call next week make sense?"
- "Let me send you [the case study / the diagnostic overview / the analysis] I mentioned. If it resonates, we can dig deeper."

**Exit Strategy (ending a conversation gracefully):**

- "I really appreciate the conversation. I want to be respectful of your time — let me grab the next session and we'll connect after the event."
- "Great to meet you. I see [person you need to talk to] over there and need to catch them before they leave. Let's connect on LinkedIn."
- "Thanks for the insight on [topic]. I want to let you mingle — I'll follow up by email next week."

## 4. At-Event Capture Template

### Quick Notes Format

After every meaningful conversation (2+ minutes), capture notes immediately. Do not wait until the end of the day. You will forget details.

**Method 1: Phone Notes (fastest)**

Open your notes app and use this format:

```
[Name] | [Company] | [Title]
Pain: [one sentence — their key challenge]
Offered: [what you said you'd send/do]
Temp: [1-5]
Next: [specific next step]
```

Example:
```
Sarah Chen | Ohio Gas Utility Inc. | VP Operations
Pain: PUCO rate case creating compliance sprint, team is stretched thin
Offered: Compliance gap checklist + case study from similar rate case
Temp: 4
Next: Email Tuesday with checklist, propose call Thursday
```

Time required: 30-60 seconds per contact.

**Method 2: Voice Memo (if you cannot type)**

Record a 15-second voice memo after walking away from the conversation:
"Just talked to Sarah Chen, VP Ops at Ohio Gas Utility. PUCO rate case is stretching her team. Offered to send compliance gap checklist. Temperature 4. Follow up Tuesday."

Transcribe voice memos during end-of-day debrief.

**Method 3: Business Card + Note**

If they hand you a business card:
- Take a photo of the card immediately (backup)
- Write on the back of the card: pain point, temperature, next step
- Drop the card in a dedicated pocket or envelope (do not mix with your own cards)

### Photo Protocol

- Photograph every business card (front and back) immediately upon receiving it
- If someone does not have a card: Ask them to spell their name and enter it in your phone contacts on the spot. Add company and title.
- If at a booth or presentation: Photo of their name badge, display, or relevant slide deck

### End-of-Day Debrief (15 minutes, non-negotiable)

Before dinner, before the reception, before you go to the hotel bar — spend 15 minutes organizing the day's contacts.

```

---

## 5. Post-Event Follow-Up Protocol

### Sorting Contacts (within 24 hours of event end)

Take the daily debriefs and create a master list sorted by priority.

**A-Priority Criteria (follow up same day or next business day):**
- Temperature 4-5 from conversation
- Expressed a specific pain point you can solve
- Asked you to send something specific
- Deal potential above $100K
- Decision-maker with budget authority

**B-Priority Criteria (follow up within 48-72 hours):**
- Temperature 3 from conversation
- General interest but no specific ask
- Influencer rather than decision-maker
- Deal potential $50K-$100K

**C-Priority Criteria (follow up within 1 week):**
- Temperature 1-2 from conversation
- Pleasant conversation but no clear pain point expressed
- Tangential connection (could be a referral source, not a direct buyer)
- Add to long-term nurture

### A-Priority Follow-Up Template

Subject: "Following up from [Event Name] — [specific topic you discussed]"

"Hi [Name],

Great talking at [Event Name] about [specific conversation reference — not generic "enjoyed meeting you" but the actual topic: "the PUCO rate case timeline and your compliance team's capacity"]. You mentioned [specific pain point they expressed], and it stuck with me.

As promised, here's [the specific thing you said you would send: checklist, case study, analysis, article]. I flagged [2-3 specific sections/items] that are most relevant to [Company]'s situation.

I also wanted to share [one additional thing they did not ask for but would find valuable — a relevant case study, a data point, an introduction to someone who solved a similar problem].

Would it make sense to continue the conversation on a call next week? I'm open [two specific time options]. Happy to dig into [specific deliverable/diagnostic] in more detail.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. [Social proof or additional value: "We built the compliance matrix for [similar company]'s rate case last year — cut their preparation time by 60%. Happy to walk through the approach."]"

### B-Priority Follow-Up Template

Subject: "Good connecting at [Event Name]"

"Hi [Name],

Enjoyed our conversation at [Event Name] about [topic]. I wanted to follow up with [the resource/insight you discussed].

We work with several Ohio [industry segment] companies on [capability], and I thought [this specific resource] might be useful as you work through [their general challenge area].

If it's ever worth exploring further, I'm happy to share more about how we approach [specific function]. No rush — just wanted to make sure you had this.

Best,
[Your Name]"

### C-Priority Follow-Up

- LinkedIn connection request with custom note: "Good connecting at [Event Name]. Let's stay in touch."
- No email unless you made a specific promise to send something
- Add to monthly nurture sequence
- Monitor for trigger events that would upgrade them to A or B priority

### Thank-You Notes to Event Organizers

Send a brief email to the event organizer within 1 week:
- Thank them for organizing the event
- Mention one specific thing you found valuable
- Ask about next year's dates/themes
- Purpose: Relationship maintenance. Organizers remember who sends thank-you notes. This increases your chances of getting speaking slots, early attendee lists, and priority registration in the future.

## 6. Event Calendar Management

### Annual Event Calendar for Ohio Energy Consulting

This calendar covers the primary conferences and industry events relevant to Ohio-based energy consulting (gas utilities, midstream operations, pipeline, power generation). Adjust annually based on ROI tracking.

| Month | Event | Location | Focus | Priority | Est. Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| January | DistribuTECH | San Diego, CA (rotates) | Utility grid modernization, smart grid, T&D | High | $4,000-$6,000 |
| February | CERAWEEK | Houston, TX | Global energy strategy, executive-level | Medium (high cost) | $8,000-$12,000 |
| March | OOGA Annual Meeting | Columbus, OH | Ohio oil and gas industry | High (local, low cost) | $800-$1,500 |
| April | COGA Annual Conference | Columbus, OH | Central Ohio gas association | High (local) | $500-$1,000 |
| May | AGA Operations Conference | Varies | Gas utility operations, safety, compliance | High | $3,000-$5,000 |
| June | Hart Energy DUG East | Pittsburgh, PA | Appalachian Basin drilling, midstream | High (regional) | $2,000-$3,500 |
| July | Summer Association Meetings | Various (Ohio/regional) | Smaller association events, golf outings | Medium | $500-$2,000 |
| August | Energy Thought Summit | Austin, TX | Energy innovation, digital transformation | Medium | $3,000-$5,000 |
| September | Turbomachinery & Pump Symposium | Houston, TX | Compressor stations, rotating equipment | Medium (technical) | $3,000-$5,000 |
| October | GPA Midstream Convention | Varies | Midstream gas processing | Medium-High | $3,000-$5,000 |

| December | Year-End Executive Dinners | Columbus/Cleveland, OH | Relationship-building, holiday networking | Medium | $200-$500 |

### Event Budget Allocation

**Annual event budget target:** $20,000-$35,000 (adjust based on total business development budget and firm revenue)

**Budget allocation rules:**
1. **40% to Tier 1 events** (highest historical ROI, highest target buyer density). Typically 2-3 events. These get full preparation using this template.
2. **30% to Tier 2 events** (regional events, moderate ROI, good networking). Typically 3-4 events. Lighter preparation but still use target dossiers.
3. **20% to Tier 3 events** (local association events, low cost, relationship maintenance). Typically 4-6 events. Show up, network, minimal preparation needed.
4. **10% reserve** for unplanned events (last-minute invitations, speaking opportunities, client events)

### Event Rotation Strategy

Not every event needs annual attendance. Use this framework:

**Attend annually:**
- Events where you have a speaking slot
- Events with ROI above 3x from prior year
- Local/low-cost events where the relationship maintenance justifies the time ($500 or less)
- Industry association events where your target buyers expect to see you

**Attend every other year:**
- National conferences where the attendee list does not change significantly year-over-year
- Events with ROI between 1x and 3x (they work but are not outstanding)
- Events where you attend primarily for learning (the content is valuable but the networking is weak)

**One-time / Evaluate annually:**
- New events you have not attended before (attend once, evaluate based on ROI tracker)
- Events where the format or leadership has changed significantly
- Events in new markets you are exploring (if the market pans out, add to rotation; if not, drop)

**Drop permanently:**
- Events with ROI below 1x for two consecutive years
- Events where target buyer density has declined below 3 known targets
- Events where competitor sponsorship dominance makes it hard to get visibility
- Events that have shifted focus away from your core expertise areas

### Pre-Season Planning (Complete by January 15 each year)

1. Review prior year's event ROI tracker for every event attended
2. Score upcoming year's events using the selection criteria matrix (Section 2)
3. Rank all events by score. Allocate budget starting from the top.
4. Register for Tier 1 events early (early bird pricing, hotel availability, speaking slot applications)
5. Block travel dates on calendar for confirmed events
6. Assign preparation timelines (start intel packets 4 weeks before each event)
7. Set CRM reminders for:
   - 4 weeks before: Begin intelligence packet
   - 2 weeks before: Send meeting requests to top targets
   - 1 week before: Finalize preparation, print materials, confirm logistics
   - Event day: Execute
   - 48 hours after: Complete A-priority follow-ups
   - 1 week after: Complete B and C follow-ups
   - 30/60/90 days after: ROI tracking milestones
