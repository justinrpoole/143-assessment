## Part 1: Visual Psychology — What Makes People Stop

### The Hierarchy of Visual Attention

The human brain processes visual information in predictable patterns. Understanding these patterns is the difference between images that command attention and those that dissolve into the feed.

**Processing Order:**
1. **Faces** (highest priority — neurologically wired)
2. **Movement / implied motion**
3. **High contrast elements**
4. **Unexpected / novel elements** (pattern interrupts)
5. **Text** (last — requires conscious processing)

### Why Faces Work

Humans are neurologically wired to notice faces before anything else. Mirror neurons activate when we see facial expressions, making us *feel* what we see.

**Effective Face Usage:**
- **Exaggerated expressions** outperform subtle (shock, excitement, curiosity)
- **Gaze direction matters**: Eyes looking at your CTA guide viewer attention there
- **Close-ups** beat full-body shots for emotional impact
- **Asymmetrical angles** create more interest than straight-on

**Anti-Pattern:**
Generic stock smile → use specific emotions that match the content's emotional payload

### The 3-Second Threshold

Research shows:
- **65%** of viewers who watch the first 3 seconds continue to 10 seconds
- **45%** will reach 30 seconds
- First impression forms in **50 milliseconds** (before conscious thought)

**Implication:** Your visual must communicate value/intrigue/emotion before conscious processing begins.

### Pattern Interrupts That Stop Scrolling

The brain filters out expected patterns. To stop the scroll, you need *novelty without confusion*.

**Effective Pattern Interrupts:**
- Unexpected color combinations (not random — intentional clash)
- Scale violations (tiny person, giant object)
- Temporal mismatch (retro aesthetic + futuristic elements)
- Context displacement (product in impossible environment)
- Visual juxtaposition (opposites in same frame)

**Example:** Perplexity's metallic asterisk on mossy green earth texture — digital + organic = attention

### High-Arousal Emotions Drive Sharing

Content that triggers **high-arousal emotions** (positive or negative) gets shared more than neutral content:

**High-Arousal (Shareable):**
- Awe, wonder, amazement
- Excitement, anticipation
- Outrage, anger (use carefully)
- Surprise, shock
- Joy, delight

**Low-Arousal (Less Shareable):**
- Contentment
- Sadness
- Calm

**Visual Translation:**
- Awe → vast scale, impossible beauty, dramatic lighting
- Excitement → movement, vibrant colors, dynamic composition
- Surprise → unexpected juxtaposition, impossible scenarios

## Part 2: Direct Response Visual Principles

### From Ogilvy, Schwartz, and Modern DTC

The advertising legends tested what works. Here is what still applies:

### Images vs. Copy: Complementary Strengths

**Images communicate with FORCE:**
- Immediate emotional impact
- Works before conscious thought
- Creates desire, not justification

**Copy communicates with PRECISION:**
- Specific claims and details
- Overcomes objections
- Provides rational scaffolding for emotional decision

**Implication:** Use images to create emotional pull, copy to close the gap.

### The Ogilvy Rules That Still Work

1. **Finished outcomes beat processes**
   - Show the result, not the work
   - Image of delicious meal > image of raw ingredients
   - After transformation > before transformation

2. **Specificity beats generality**
   - "A 42-year-old founder in Austin" > "an entrepreneur"
   - Precise details trigger identification

3. **Reader-first composition**
   - People look at illustrations first, then headlines, then body
   - Visual hierarchy must match this sequence

4. **Authenticity over polish**
   - Real contexts beat sterile studios
   - Lifestyle imagery reduces psychological distance
   - User-generated aesthetic often outperforms professional

### Visual Hierarchy for Conversion

```
ATTENTION SEQUENCE:
1. PRIMARY FOCAL POINT (the hook)
   ↓
2. SUPPORTING CONTEXT (why care)
   ↓
3. CALL TO ACTION (what to do)
```

**Hick's Law:** More choices = slower decisions = lower conversion
- One dominant visual element
- One clear message
- One obvious next step

### The Rule of Thirds (Actually Useful)

Divide frame into 9 segments (3x3 grid). Place key elements on intersecting lines, not dead center.

**Why it works:**
- Creates visual tension and interest
- Matches natural eye scanning patterns
- Leaves room for composition to "breathe"

**Anti-Pattern:** Centered subjects feel static and amateur

## Part 3: Anti-Generic AI Aesthetic Principles

### Understanding "AI Slop"

AI slop = high volume + low effort + statistical averages = forgettable

**Why It Happens:**
- Models trained to predict "most likely" output
- Without specific direction, AI defaults to training data averages
- Generic prompts → generic results
- "Beautiful woman in fashionable clothing" → Eurocentric defaults, conventional poses, sterile compositions

### The Generic AI Markers (Avoid These)

**Visual Tells:**
- Perfectly centered composition
- Uniform, directionless lighting
- Overly smooth/plastic skin texture
- Symmetrical everything
- "Too perfect" Disney aesthetic
- Hands that do not look right
- Gibberish text
- Repetitive background elements
- Unnatural reflections

**Aesthetic Tells:**
- High saturation + no color strategy
- Gradient backgrounds to nowhere
- Generic "tech blue" palette
- Stock photo poses
- Inspirational quote + sunset vibes

### The Anti-Generic Framework

**1. Strategic Specificity**
Instead of describing what you want generically, specify:
- Exact time of day / lighting condition
- Specific artistic movement or reference
- Precise color palette with hex codes or names
- One or two distinctive anchor elements
- Mood/emotion in specific terms

**Generic:** "A professional looking office"
**Specific:** "A warm afternoon-lit workspace with golden hour streaming through venetian blinds, casting striped shadows across a worn mahogany desk, muted earth tones, shot on medium format film"

**2. Constraint as Creative Tool**

Limits force originality. Add constraints:
- "No typical poses"
- "Avoid centered composition"
- "Non-uniform lighting only"
- "Imperfect textures"

**3. Multi-Dimensional Style Architecture**

Do not rely on single style keywords. Specify across dimensions:

```
STYLE ARCHITECTURE:
├── Lighting (direction, quality, temperature)
├── Color Palette (specific palette, not just "colorful")
├── Composition (rule, framing, depth)
├── Artistic Reference (movement, artist, era)
├── Technical Treatment (camera, film stock, processing)
├── Texture/Surface (material quality, imperfections)
└── Emotional Register (specific mood, energy)
```

**Example Build:**
- Lighting: "Backlit with rim lighting, deep shadows"
- Color: "Desaturated rust orange and slate blue"
- Composition: "Dutch angle, tight crop"
- Reference: "Annie Leibovitz environmental portrait"
- Technical: "Shot on Hasselblad, shallow depth of field"
- Texture: "Film grain, natural skin texture"
- Mood: "Contemplative tension, quiet intensity"

**4. The Iteration Loop**

Professional workflow: Generate → Critique → Refine (repeat)

**Critique Questions:**
- Did this fall into any generic patterns?
- What is the most distinctive element?
- What would make this impossible to ignore?
- Does this feel intentional or accidental?

## Part 4: Anti-AI-Slop Playbook

This section is specifically about avoiding the "obviously AI-generated" look that has become its own form of visual noise. As AI-generated content floods every platform, audiences have developed an intuitive ability to spot and skip AI slop. Avoiding these patterns is now a competitive requirement.

### The 7 Dead Giveaways of AI Slop

**1. Over-Saturated Colors**

AI models tend to push colors 20-40% more saturated than reality. This creates a "candy-coated" look that screams artificial.

**Fix:** Add desaturation language to prompts. Use specific, muted color names instead of generic ones.
- Instead of: "vibrant red" → "muted terracotta" or "burgundy"
- Instead of: "bright blue" → "slate blue" or "dusty navy"
- Add: "desaturated color palette", "natural color grading", "muted tones"

**2. Plastic Skin / Porcelain People**

AI smooths skin to an uncanny perfection. Pores, texture, and natural skin variation disappear.

**Fix:** Explicitly request natural skin in prompts.
- Add: "natural skin texture", "visible pores", "realistic skin"
- Add: "shot on film" or "film grain" (introduces natural texture)
- Specify imperfections: "freckles", "laugh lines", "sun-weathered"

**3. Too-Perfect Symmetry**

Real-world photography is never perfectly symmetrical. AI defaults to bilateral symmetry because it is statistically "most likely."

**Fix:** Break symmetry intentionally.
- Add: "asymmetrical composition", "off-center subject"
- Specify: "slightly turned head", "casual posture", "weight on one foot"
- Use: "candid moment" rather than "portrait"

**4. The AI Glow / HDR Effect**

An unnatural, even illumination where everything is lit from everywhere. No real light source.

**Fix:** Specify directional, motivated lighting.
- Add: "single light source from upper left"
- Add: "deep shadows", "chiaroscuro", "motivated lighting"
- Specify: "overcast daylight" or "window light from the right" — real-world conditions
- Avoid: "well-lit", "bright lighting" (these encourage flat AI lighting)

**5. Generic Stock Photo Compositions**

The "person smiling at camera with thumbs up" or "diverse group of professionals in meeting room" compositions that feel pre-canned.

**Fix:** Describe specific, narrative moments.
- Instead of: "team in meeting" → "founder sketching on whiteboard at 2am, coffee cups scattered, laptop glow on face"
- Instead of: "happy customer" → "woman mid-laugh at a cafe, looking at her phone, afternoon light"
- The more specific the narrative moment, the less generic the output

**6. Impossible Backgrounds / Object Soup**

Background elements that dissolve into vague shapes, or objects that have no real-world logic.

**Fix:** Describe the background as specifically as the foreground.
- Add: "on weathered concrete surface" not just "on surface"
- Add: "brick wall with peeling paint in background" not just "urban background"
- Every object in the scene should have a reason to be there

**7. The "AI Art Station" Aesthetic**

An overly polished, hyper-rendered look that blends concept art, CGI, and illustration into a generic "AI art" house style. Too many highlights, too much bloom, too many particle effects.

**Fix:** Ground the image in a real-world photographic reference.
- Add camera references: "shot on Fujifilm X-T5", "35mm film photography"
- Add processing references: "minimal post-processing", "straight out of camera"
- Avoid: "ultra-detailed", "hyper-realistic", "8K" — these push toward the overprocessed AI look
- Instead use: "professional photography", "editorial quality", "commercial photography"

### The Authenticity Spectrum

```
MOST AUTHENTIC ◄──────────────────────────────► MOST ARTIFICIAL

Film grain        Professional    HDR/saturated    Hyper-rendered
Natural texture   photography     Everything lit    AI Art Station
Visible wear      Clean but real  Plastic smooth    Fantasy bloom
Candid moment     Posed natural   Stock pose        Perfect symmetry
```

**Target the left side.** As AI content floods the right side, authenticity becomes the differentiator.

### Quick Anti-Slop Prompt Additions

Add these to any prompt to reduce AI-obvious markers:

```
Anti-slop base layer (pick 2-3 relevant ones):
- "natural color grading, not over-saturated"
- "realistic lighting with visible shadows"
- "shot on [specific camera], [specific lens]"
- "natural skin texture" (for people)
- "slight film grain"
- "asymmetrical composition"
- "candid, not posed"
- "environmental context, not studio"
- "minimal post-processing"
```

## Part 7: Platform-Specific Visual Strategy

### Instagram Feed (2025-2026 Data)

**What Performs:**
- Carousels: 0.55% engagement rate (highest format)
- Reels shared to feed outperform static images 2-3x
- Multi-image storytelling continues to dominate
- Educational sequences with bold text on first slide

**Visual Strategy:**
- Consistent color palette across carousel slides
- Rule of thirds composition
- High contrast for feed visibility
- Hook on first slide — value promise or pattern interrupt
- 4:5 aspect ratio occupies maximum feed real estate

**Aspect Ratio:** `4:5` for feed posts (maximum height in feed), `1:1` for cross-platform reuse

**Anti-Pattern:** Single static images without story arc. Carousels outperform by 2-3x.

---

### Instagram Stories & Reels

**What Performs:**
- 60-90 second Reels (not shorter — algorithm rewards completion of longer content)
- Trending sounds increase discovery 30-40%
- Pattern interrupt opening (first 0.5 seconds)
- UGC aesthetic outperforms polished production

**Visual Strategy:**
- Movement in first frame (no static opens)
- Close-up faces with emotion
- Bold text overlays for silent viewing
- High contrast color, especially in the first second

**Aspect Ratio:** `9:16` always

**The Hook:** You have 0.5-1 second for stories, 3 seconds for Reels.

---

### YouTube Thumbnails

**What Performs:**
- Click-through rate is the primary discovery metric
- Faces with exaggerated expressions: 25-40% higher CTR than no face
- 3-5 words maximum text
- Complementary colors to title (not matching)

**Visual Strategy:**
- Background blur/darken to isolate subject
- Complementary (not matching) colors to video title
- Curiosity gap (show result, hide method)
- Arrows/circles sparingly — overuse has reduced their effectiveness
- Before/after split compositions perform well for tutorial content

**Aspect Ratio:** `16:9` (1280x720 minimum, 1920x1080 preferred)

**3-Second Test:** Can a stranger understand the value from the thumbnail alone?

---

### LinkedIn (2025-2026 Data)

**What Performs:**
- Multi-image carousels: 6.6% engagement rate
- Document posts (PDF carousels): 6.1%
- Native video: 5.6%
- Poll posts: 5.8%
- Text + single image: 3.2%

**Visual Strategy:**
- Professional but not corporate (the line has shifted — authenticity wins)
- Data visualization and infographics
- Minimal, clean composition
- Thought leadership aesthetic — "executive with ideas" not "corporate with stock photos"
- Dark backgrounds perform well in dark mode (LinkedIn's growing default)

**Aspect Ratio:** `1:1` for posts, `16:9` for article headers and link previews

**Color Psychology:**
- Dark blues = trust, professionalism
- White space = sophistication
- Minimal accent colors (one is enough)

---

### TikTok

**What Performs:**
- Hook in first 0.3 seconds (even faster than Instagram)
- Authenticity dramatically outperforms polish
- Text-on-screen is mandatory (80%+ watch with sound off at some point)
- Pattern interrupts: physical movement, unexpected visuals, direct-to-camera address

**Proven Hook Types:**
1. **Pattern interrupt** — unexpected visual/audio in first frame
2. **List format** — "3 ways to..."
3. **Curiosity gap** — incomplete information that demands completion
4. **Question** — voices viewer's internal thought
5. **Pain point** — "tired of..."
6. **Bold claim** — provocative assertion that demands attention
7. **Story tease** — narrative setup that promises payoff

**Visual Strategy:**
- Vertical native (9:16) — never letterboxed
- Movement in first frame
- Face + emotion (UGC feel)
- Text overlays: large, high contrast, positioned in safe zone (center 80%)

**Aspect Ratio:** `9:16` exclusively

---

### X / Twitter

**What Performs:**
- Native video: 10x engagement vs text-only
- Videos under 2:20 that achieve high completion rate = algorithm reward
- Replies valued 13-27x higher than likes for distribution
- Quote tweets with added visual context outperform retweets
- Image posts with 1-2 images outperform 3-4 image layouts

**Visual Strategy:**
- High contrast for dark mode (now the majority of users)
- Text legibility at small sizes — test at mobile preview scale
- Quick visual communication — Twitter is a speed medium
- Bold, graphic imagery over photographic subtlety

**Aspect Ratio:** `16:9` for images and video, `1:1` also supported

---

### Pinterest (2025-2026 Data)

**What Performs:**
- Tall pins (2:3 ratio) occupy maximum visual space in the feed
- Step-by-step instructional images
- Text overlay with clear benefit statement
- Warm, aspirational photography (Pinterest audience skews toward planning/aspiration)

**Visual Strategy:**
- Tall vertical composition with clear visual hierarchy
- Product in lifestyle context (not isolated on white)
- Warm, bright, inviting color palettes
- Text at top: benefit/title. Image fills remaining space.
- Seasonal and trend-aligned content gets amplified

**Aspect Ratio:** `2:3` (1000x1500 optimal)

---

## Part 8: Prompt Construction for Nano Banana Pro

Nano Banana Pro (google/nano-banana-pro) is the default image model for the creative engine. These guidelines are specific to how this model interprets prompts.

### The Prompt Formula

```
[SUBJECT with specific details] + [SETTING with environmental context] +
[STYLE reference] + [LIGHTING with direction and quality] +
[COLOR PALETTE with specific names] + [MOOD in precise emotional terms] +
[TECHNICAL reference for texture/processing]
```

### How Nano Banana Pro Reads Prompts

**What it does well:**
- Follows detailed natural language descriptions faithfully
- Handles multiple style references without confusion
- Renders text and typography better than most models
- Understands camera and lens references (translates to appropriate depth of field, perspective, etc.)
- Responds well to specific color names and palettes
- Handles complex multi-element compositions

**What it struggles with:**
- Very long prompts (500+ words) — keep under 300 words for reliability
- Abstract concepts without visual anchors — always give it something concrete
- Exact spatial relationships between many objects — keep compositions to 2-3 key elements
- Consistent character appearance across multiple generations (use brand kit techniques below)
- Hands in complex poses — keep hand references simple or crop them out

### Subject Specificity Guide

The more specific the subject, the less the model guesses. Guessing = generic.

```
WEAK ──────────────────────────────────── STRONG

"a coffee cup"                            "handmade ceramic coffee cup with
                                           matte sage green glaze, slight
                                           irregularity in the rim, latte
                                           art rosetta visible, wisps of
                                           steam catching the light"

"a laptop"                                "silver MacBook Pro on aged oak
                                           desk, screen showing a code editor
                                           with dark theme, desk lamp casting
                                           warm pool of light from the left"

"a person working"                        "woman in her mid-30s, hair loosely
                                           tied back, reading glasses pushed
                                           up on forehead, mid-thought with
                                           pen to lips, afternoon window
                                           light catching dust particles"
```

### Lighting as Mood Control

Lighting is the single most impactful prompt element after the subject. Nano Banana Pro responds particularly well to specific lighting descriptions.

| Lighting Description | Mood It Creates | When to Use |
|---------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| "soft natural daylight from a window" | Calm, authentic, approachable | Lifestyle, editorial |
| "golden hour light, long shadows" | Warm, nostalgic, aspirational | Brand storytelling, lifestyle |
| "single dramatic spotlight from upper left" | Premium, focused, confident | Product hero shots |
| "overcast diffused light, no harsh shadows" | Even, clean, professional | E-commerce, product catalog |
| "backlit with rim lighting, deep shadows" | Dramatic, mysterious, high-end | Fashion, luxury, tech |
| "neon accent lighting, cyan and magenta" | Energetic, modern, nightlife | Entertainment, youth brands |
| "chiaroscuro, dramatic light-dark contrast" | Artistic, powerful, serious | Editorial, thought leadership |
| "flat even studio lighting" | Clean, commercial, no drama | Product documentation, UI mockups |

### Color Palette Integration

Never say "colorful" or "vibrant colors." Always specify the palette.

**Effective patterns:**
```
"warm palette of terracotta (#C4704A), cream (#F5F0E8), and deep forest (#1B3A2D)"
"monochromatic blue palette ranging from #0A1628 to #4A9BD9"
"complementary contrast of rust orange and cool slate blue"
"muted earth tones: sand, warm grey, dried sage, soft clay"
```

**Nano Banana Pro understands hex codes** in prompts. Using them produces more precise color results than generic color names alone.

### Quality and Realism Modifiers

**For photographic realism:**
```
"shot on Fujifilm X-T5 with 56mm f/1.2 lens"
"medium format film photography, slight grain"
"editorial photography, Condé Nast quality"
"commercial product photography, Phase One"
```

**For illustration/stylized:**
```
"digital illustration, clean vector style"
"watercolor with visible brush strokes and paper texture"
"risograph print, slight misregistration, textured paper"
"Japanese woodblock print aesthetic, limited color palette"
```

**Avoid these overused quality boosters** (they push toward AI slop):
- "ultra-detailed" — pushes toward over-rendered
- "8K resolution" — does nothing useful, triggers hyper-processing
- "hyper-realistic" — uncanny valley territory
- "masterpiece" — generic booster with no specific meaning
- "best quality" — same as "masterpiece"

**Use instead:**
- "professional photography" — grounded in real-world standard
- "editorial quality" — implies taste and curation
- "commercial campaign quality" — implies real-world usage standard
- "[specific photographer] style" — references a real aesthetic

## Part 9: Text Rendering & Typography in AI Images

Nano Banana Pro has significantly better text rendering capabilities than previous generation models. However, text in AI-generated images still requires specific techniques to get clean results.

### When to Render Text in the Image vs. Overlay Later

| Scenario | Approach | Why |
|----------|----------|-----|
| Text is integrated into the scene (signs, labels, packaging) | Render in image | Needs to interact with lighting, perspective, materials |
| Text is a UI element or overlay (headline, CTA, caption) | Add in post-production | More control over font, sizing, positioning |
| Short text (1-4 words) | Render in image | Model handles short text well |
| Long text (5+ words, paragraphs) | Add in post-production | Error rate increases with text length |
| Stylized/decorative text (neon signs, graffiti, embossed) | Render in image | Style integration requires generation |

### Best Practices for Text Rendering

**Keep it short.** 1-4 words render cleanly. Each additional word increases the chance of errors.

**Specify the text exactly in quotes:**
```
Good: 'large neon sign reading "OPEN" in red cursive'
Bad:  'a sign that says something about being open'
```

**Describe the typography style:**
```
'bold sans-serif text reading "LAUNCH" in white, condensed uppercase'
'elegant serif text reading "Artisan" in gold foil on dark leather'
'hand-painted vintage sign reading "CAFE" in cream on weathered wood'
```

**Describe the text material and surface:**
```
'chrome 3D letters spelling "PRO" with metallic reflections'
'embossed text reading "PREMIUM" pressed into thick cotton paper'
'frosted glass text reading "HELLO" backlit with soft blue light'
```

### Common Text Rendering Issues and Fixes

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Letters are swapped or duplicated | Regenerate. This is stochastic — same prompt may work on next attempt. |
| Text is partially legible | Shorten the text. Remove any word that is not essential. |
| Wrong font style | Be more specific: "bold geometric sans-serif" not just "modern font" |
| Text does not interact with lighting | Add: "text catching the same [lighting description] as the scene" |
| Text floats unnaturally | Specify the surface: "text painted on the wall", "text engraved in the surface" |

### Typography Style Keywords for Nano Banana Pro

```
Serif:        "elegant serif", "classic roman", "editorial serif", "high-contrast serif"
Sans-serif:   "clean sans-serif", "geometric sans", "humanist sans", "condensed gothic"
Display:      "bold display type", "compressed headline", "ultra-black", "fat face"
Script:       "flowing script", "casual handwriting", "formal calligraphy", "brush script"
Decorative:   "vintage lettering", "art deco type", "psychedelic lettering", "stencil"
Technical:    "monospace", "terminal font", "code editor typeface", "engineering stencil"
```

## Part 10: Brand Consistency Across Multiple Generations

The biggest challenge in AI creative production is maintaining visual consistency across multiple generations. Each API call is independent — the model has no memory of previous outputs. These techniques create consistency without model memory.

### The Brand Prompt Prefix

Create a standard prefix that is prepended to every prompt for a project:

```
Brand prefix (example):
"In the [Brand Name] visual style: warm terracotta (#C4704A) and cream (#F5F0E8)
color palette, soft natural lighting, minimal composition with generous negative
space, shot on medium format film with subtle grain, editorial quality. "
```

This prefix goes at the START of every prompt. It anchors the model to a consistent aesthetic before the specific subject description begins.

### Style Lock Document

After the 5-direction exploration process (described in SKILL.md), create a style lock document:

```markdown
## Style Lock: [Project Name]

### Color Anchors
- Primary surface: [color + hex]
- Accent: [color + hex]
- Background: [color + hex]
- Mood modifier: [color + hex]

### Lighting Lock
- Direction: [e.g., "upper left, 45 degrees"]
- Quality: [e.g., "soft diffused, no harsh shadows"]
- Temperature: [e.g., "warm, 4000K equivalent"]

### Composition Rules
- Framing: [e.g., "rule of thirds, subject on left intersection"]
- Negative space: [e.g., "30% minimum, right side for text overlay"]
- Depth: [e.g., "shallow depth of field, f/2.8 equivalent"]

### Texture/Processing
- Base: [e.g., "slight film grain, natural skin texture"]
- Color grade: [e.g., "warm shadows, cool highlights, low contrast"]
- Avoid: [e.g., "HDR look, over-saturation, plastic smoothing"]

### Prompt Template
[The exact prompt structure with {{variables}} for subject matter]
```

### Consistency Techniques

**1. Anchor Colors with Hex Codes**

Nano Banana Pro understands hex codes. Using them produces more consistent color results than descriptive names.

```
Less consistent: "warm orange and cream"
More consistent: "terracotta #C4704A and cream #F5F0E8"
```

**2. Consistent Lighting Description**

Use the exact same lighting phrase across all prompts. Do not paraphrase.

```
Locked phrase: "soft natural daylight from a large window on the left, warm tone"

Prompt 1: "Product bottle [locked lighting phrase], on marble countertop..."
Prompt 2: "Model wearing jacket [locked lighting phrase], in studio space..."
Prompt 3: "Close-up of texture [locked lighting phrase], on linen surface..."
```

**3. Consistent Camera/Technical Reference**

The same camera reference produces similar depth of field, grain, and tonal characteristics.

```
Locked technical: "shot on Hasselblad X2D, 90mm f/3.2, slight film emulation"
```

Use this exact phrase in every prompt for the project.

**4. Seed Reuse for Variations**

When you find a generation you like, note the seed. Use that seed with modified prompts to get variations that share a similar "feel" (though this is not guaranteed — it increases consistency probability, not certainty).

**5. Reference Image Workflow**

For maximum consistency, use the image editing capability of Nano Banana Pro:
1. Generate the first image and approve it
2. For subsequent images, provide the approved image as `image_input` with a prompt describing the variation
3. This anchors the model to the established visual style

### What Breaks Consistency

- Changing the lighting description between prompts
- Using different color names for the same color
- Mixing camera references ("shot on iPhone" in one, "Hasselblad" in another)
- Adding conflicting style keywords ("warm" in one prompt, "cool-toned" in another)
- Omitting the brand prefix from any prompt

## Part 12: Quality Checklist

Before approving any visual:

### Distinctiveness
- [ ] Would this stop my scrolling?
- [ ] Does this pass the "Is this AI?" test? (it should not look obviously generated)
- [ ] Is there a distinctive visual element I can describe?
- [ ] Would I know this brand from the visual alone?
- [ ] Does this avoid every item in the Anti-AI-Slop list?

### Technical Quality
- [ ] Is composition intentional (not centered by default)?
- [ ] Is lighting directional and motivated (not flat AI glow)?
- [ ] Are there natural imperfections (texture, grain, variation)?
- [ ] Do materials look physically accurate?
- [ ] Are colors natural (not over-saturated)?
- [ ] Is text (if present) legible and correctly spelled?

### Strategic Alignment
- [ ] Does this match the brand's creative-kit.md?
- [ ] Is the emotional register appropriate for the message?
- [ ] Does this serve the communication goal?
- [ ] Is this differentiated from competitors' visuals?

### Platform Optimization
- [ ] Right aspect ratio for target platform?
- [ ] Will this work at thumbnail/preview size?
- [ ] Does it hook within 3 seconds (video) or 0.5 seconds (image in feed)?
- [ ] Is text legible at mobile size?
- [ ] Does it work in both light and dark mode (if platform supports both)?

### Brand Consistency
- [ ] Colors match the brand palette (check hex codes)?
- [ ] Lighting matches the style lock?
- [ ] Camera/technical treatment is consistent with other assets?
- [ ] This could sit alongside other project assets without looking like a different brand?

## Implementation Notes

This document is a reference, not a rigid system. The best creative work happens when you:

1. **Start with the communication goal** — What needs to be felt/understood?
2. **Choose aesthetic direction intentionally** — Match style to strategy
3. **Specify across multiple dimensions** — Do not rely on single keywords
4. **Apply anti-slop techniques by default** — Every prompt should include at least 2-3 anti-slop modifiers
5. **Iterate aggressively** — Generate, critique, refine
6. **Question your defaults** — The first idea is rarely the most distinctive
7. **Maintain brand consistency** — Use the brand prefix, style lock, and consistent technical references

The goal is not to follow these rules. It is to understand the principles deeply enough to break them intentionally.
