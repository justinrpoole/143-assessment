## LinkedIn Deep Dive

### The Algorithm (December 2025)

LinkedIn uses a **three-step process**: quality filtering (spam/low/high classification), engagement testing (initial audience sample in first hour), and network/relevance ranking based on user interests and poster expertise.

**Priority signals:**

1. **Dwell Time** — How long someone spends reading your post (still #1)
2. **Topic Authority** — Consistent niche posting builds algorithmic trust over time
3. **Authentic Engagement** — AI detects engagement pods via comment velocity, patterns, and semantics
4. **Relevance Over Recency** — Mid-2025 update shows older posts (2-3 weeks) if highly relevant to user
5. **Native Content** — Posts without external links get significantly more reach

**The Golden Hour:** First 60 minutes determines whether your post reaches 2nd/3rd-degree connections. Strong early engagement = exponential reach.

**2025 Reality:** Organic views down ~50%, engagement down ~25%, follower growth down ~59% as LinkedIn prioritizes quality, relevance, and authentic expertise over volume.

### Carousel Mechanics

**Why carousels work:**
- Force longer dwell time (each swipe = more time on post)
- Educational content performs best on LinkedIn
- Save-worthy = algorithm gold
- Can be repurposed to Instagram with minor tweaks

**Optimal carousel structure:**

| Slide | Purpose | Design Notes |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| 1 | Hook | Bold text, minimal design, creates curiosity |
| 2 | Setup | Why this matters or what's wrong |
| 3-7 | Content | One point per slide, readable at small size |
| 8 | Summary | Quick reference version |
| 9 | CTA | Save, follow, repost |

**Design specs:**
- 1080x1350px (4:5 ratio) — Takes up maximum feed space
- Max 10 slides per carousel
- Font size: Minimum 24pt for body, 40pt+ for headlines
- High contrast (dark text on light, or vice versa)
- Consistent design system across slides

## Twitter/X Deep Dive

### The Algorithm (December 2025)

X prioritizes content in the **For You** feed based on recency, engagement, relevance, media, account credibility, and diversity.

**Priority signals:**

1. **Replies** — Highest weight, especially from accounts you engage with
2. **Quote Tweets** — 2x engagement value vs plain retweet
3. **Time Spent** — On tweet and on clicked links
4. **Media Boost** — Images/videos/GIFs increase visibility scores
5. **Profile Clicks** — Curiosity driven by tweet

**2025 Changes Under Elon Musk:**
- **Following feed now uses Grok AI** for ranking (based on past interactions and topics)—no longer purely chronological
- Users default to **For You** feed, not Following
- Stronger push on early engagement amplification and trending/local signals

**Thread mechanics:**
- First tweet determines 90% of thread success
- Optimal thread length: 8-15 tweets
- Add value in every tweet (no filler)
- Media per tweet boosts engagement
- Early engagement (first hours) critical for amplification

### Thread Architecture

**Tweet 1: The Hook**
```
[Bold claim or promise]

[One-line elaboration]

A thread on [topic]:
```

**Tweet 2: The Setup**
```
First, some context:

[Why this matters]
[Who needs to hear this]
```

**Tweets 3-X: The Content**
```
[Number]. [Point headline]

[2-3 lines of explanation]

[Example or proof]
```

**Tweet X-1: The Summary**
```
TL;DR:

- [Point 1]
- [Point 2]
- [Point 3]
- [Point 4]
- [Point 5]
```

**Tweet X: The CTA**
```
If this was useful:

1. Follow @[handle] for more
2. Retweet the first tweet
3. [Specific action related to content]

[Link if relevant]
```

## Instagram Deep Dive

### The Algorithm (December 2025)

Instagram uses **multiple ranking systems** for Feed, Reels, Stories, and Explore—each weighing signals differently.

**Priority signals:**

1. **DM Shares ("Sends Per Reach")** — Now one of the STRONGEST discovery signals, especially for Reels and Explore
2. **Saves** — Still critical for Feed and Explore; indicates long-term value
3. **Watch Time & Retention** — For Reels, completion rate is king
4. **Likes Per Reach** — Quality signal (not raw likes)
5. **Relationship Signals** — DMs, profile taps, comment history strengthen your visibility to those users
6. **Early Velocity** — First 30-90 minutes determines push to wider audience

**2025 Changes:**
- **Photos getting more support in Feed** (Adam Mosseri statement)—rebalancing, not abandoning video
- **Carousels expanded to 20 slides** in some regions
- **Hashtag weighting significantly reduced**—content signals matter more than tags
- New **"Your Algorithm" feature** lets users see why they're seeing content and remove interests

**Reels vs. Carousels:**
- Reels: Best for discovery and new eyeballs (7-15 sec for viral, 30-45 sec for tutorials)
- Carousels: Highest engagement, best for saves and depth (6-10 slides sweet spot)
- Photos: Getting renewed support in 2025, especially for photo-native audiences

### Carousel Deep Dive

**Why carousels dominate:**
- Each swipe = more time on post = algorithmic boost
- Swipe-through rate signals interest
- Save-worthy format for educational content
- Can tell a story across slides

**Slide-by-slide breakdown:**

| Slide | Goal | Design Principle |
|-------|------|------------------|
| 1 | Stop scroll | Bold text, curiosity, minimal elements |
| 2 | Hook deeper | "Here's the problem" or "Most people think" |
| 3-7 | Deliver value | One point per slide, readable, visual |
| 8-9 | Recap | Summary for those who swiped fast |
| 10 | Convert | Save, follow, share CTA |

### Reel Mechanics

**The 3-second rule:**
- 65% of viewers decide to keep watching or scroll in first 3 seconds
- Front-load the hook visually AND verbally
- Start mid-action, not with intro

**Optimal Reel lengths:**
- 7-15 seconds: Highest completion rate
- 15-30 seconds: Good for tutorials
- 30-60 seconds: Acceptable if value is dense
- 60-90 seconds: Only for highly engaged audiences

**Reel patterns that work:**

1. **Talking head + text overlay**
   - You speaking + key points as text
   - Best for thought leadership

2. **Before/After**
   - Show transformation immediately
   - Best for results-based content

3. **POV + Scenario**
   - "POV: You're [relatable situation]"
   - Best for humor/relatability

4. **Tutorial/How-to**
   - Show the process
   - Best for actionable content

5. **Trending audio + niche twist**
   - Use trending sound with your industry angle
   - Best for discovery

## TikTok Deep Dive

### The Algorithm (December 2025)

TikTok's 2025 algorithm prioritizes **enhanced personalization**, focusing on watch time (especially first seconds), niche communities, contextual content understanding, and video quality.

**Priority signals:**

1. **Watch Time (First Seconds)** — Completion rate is #1, but early seconds weighted heavily
2. **Rewatch Rate** — Multiple views = strong signal
3. **Shares** — Especially to DMs
4. **Niche Community Alignment** — 2025 rewards specialized audiences over broad virality
5. **Contextual Categorization** — AI distinguishes humor, education, emotion to match interests
6. **Video Quality** — Lighting, sound, editing now integrated into ranking

**2025 Changes:**
- **Longer content favoritism** — Algorithm now favors 30-60+ seconds if retention is high
- **Niche community boost** — Specialized audiences (#BookTok, #MarketingTok) get rewarded over generic viral attempts
- **Deeper AI personalization** — Analyzes watch duration, replays, and cross-platform media habits
- **Contextual understanding** — AI categorizes content type to better match user preferences

**The testing pattern:**
- TikTok shows your video to small groups first (~200-500 people)
- If engagement is strong, it shows to more
- Each "batch" must perform for the next batch to see it
- This is why first 3 seconds determine everything

### Hook Mastery

**The 3-second test:**
- What is the viewer seeing visually?
- What are they hearing?
- What question/curiosity is planted?

**Hook categories:**

**1. Identity Callout**
> "This is for my [specific group]..."
> "If you're a [identity], you need to hear this"
> "Only [role] will understand this"

**2. Pattern Interrupt**
> [Start mid-action, no intro]
> [Unexpected visual that doesn't match audio]
> [Jump cut to key moment]

**3. Controversy Spark**
> "I'm gonna get hate for this but..."
> "[Popular opinion] is wrong. Here's why."
> "Unpopular opinion in the [industry] space:"

**4. Proof First**
> [Show the result, then explain]
> "Here's how I [got result]"
> [Before/after with outcome first]

**5. Curiosity Gap**
> "The thing about [topic] that nobody talks about..."
> "I can't believe [brand/industry] doesn't want you to know this"
> "This one thing changed everything:"

### Video Structure Patterns

**The Rapid Teach (15-30 sec):**
```
0-3 sec: Hook (bold claim)
3-25 sec: 3-5 rapid points
25-30 sec: CTA or loop point
```

**The Story Hook (30-60 sec):**
```
0-3 sec: Start in the middle ("So there I was...")
3-10 sec: Setup context
10-45 sec: Story with tension
45-60 sec: Payoff/lesson
```

**The Myth Bust (15-45 sec):**
```
0-3 sec: "Stop believing [myth]"
3-30 sec: Why it's wrong + what's true
30-45 sec: What to do instead
```

**The POV (15-30 sec):**
```
0-3 sec: "POV: [relatable scenario]"
3-25 sec: Act out the scenario
25-30 sec: Punchline or insight
```

## YouTube Deep Dive

### The Algorithm (December 2025)

YouTube optimizes for **viewer satisfaction and retention** across both Shorts and long-form, with AI-driven personalization and stronger quality/authority checks.

**Video-level signals:**
- **Click-through rate (CTR)** — How often people click when shown your video
- **Average view duration & % watched** — Raw watch time AND completion percentage
- **Session impact** — Does your video keep people on YouTube longer?
- **Viewer satisfaction** — YouTube uses surveys + behavior to estimate quality
- **Negative feedback** — "Not interested," skips, very low retention hurt you

**Channel-level signals:**
- **Topical consistency and authority** — Focused channels get recommended more
- **History of viewer satisfaction** — Based on surveys + engagement over time
- **Upload regularity and library depth** — More data for the system to work with

**2025 Changes:**
- **AI-driven hyper-personalization** — Device, time of day, individual habits
- **Evergreen revival** — Old videos get surfaced when topics trend again
- **Authority/depth emphasis** — Aligned with Google Search updates; entity-rich content rewarded
- **Single satisfaction objective** — Shorts and long-form both feed channel understanding

### Shorts vs. Long-Form

**YouTube Shorts:**
- Discovery engine (like TikTok FYP)
- Drives subscribers but lower watch time value
- Can repurpose TikTok content
- 10-35 seconds optimal for discovery, up to 60 for stories

**Long-Form:**
- Monetization engine (ad revenue)
- Search + browse (evergreen discovery)
- 8-12 minutes sweet spot for most niches
- Builds deeper audience relationship

### Thumbnail Psychology

**The 3-element rule:**
- Maximum 3 visual elements
- Face, text, object (or any combination of 2-3)

**What drives clicks:**

| Element | Why It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| Expressive face | Emotion is magnetic |
| Bold text (3-4 words max) | Adds context at small size |
| Before/after | Curiosity about transformation |
| Contrast colors | Stands out in feed |
| Curiosity gap | Shows outcome, not process |

**What kills clicks:**
- Cluttered design
- Generic thumbnails
- Too much text
- Low contrast
- Face with neutral expression

**CTR Benchmarks (December 2025):**
- **Home & Suggested:** 4-10% typical; 6-12% is strong for established channels
- **Search-driven content:** 8-15% CTR for well-targeted how-to/tutorial topics
- **Shorts:** CTR less relevant—swipe-through vs swipe-away is the analog

Note: YouTube balances CTR with watch time and satisfaction. Clickbait that gets clicks but poor retention gets down-ranked.

### Title Formulas That Work

**The "How" Title:**
> "How I [Achieved Result] in [Timeframe]"
> "How to [Achieve Outcome] (Step-by-Step)"
> "How [Known Person/Company] [Does Thing]"

**The Number Title:**
> "[Number] [Things] That [Outcome]"
> "[Number] Mistakes [Role] Make"
> "[Number] Signs [Situation]"

**The Curiosity Title:**
> "Why [Surprising Thing] Is [Counterintuitive Truth]"
> "The [Adjective] [Thing] That [Outcome]"
> "What [Expert/Company] Doesn't Want You to Know About [Topic]"

**The Transformation Title:**
> "I [Did X] for [Time Period]. Here's What Happened."
> "From [State A] to [State B]: My Journey"
> "[Result] in [Timeframe]: Exactly How I Did It"

### Long-Form Structure (AIDA Framework)

**Attention (0-30 seconds):**
- Pattern interrupt or bold claim
- Quick credibility (if needed)
- Preview of value
- "Stay until the end for [bonus]"

**Interest (30 sec - 2 min):**
- Why this matters
- Who this is for
- What you'll cover
- Build anticipation

**Desire (Main content):**
- Deliver on promise
- Clear sections
- Examples and proof
- Verbal signposting ("First... Next... Finally...")

**Action (Last 30 seconds):**
- Summary
- Clear next step
- End screen (subscribe + next video)

## Threads Deep Dive

### The Algorithm (February 2026)

Threads uses a **blended chronological + interest-based feed** that pulls from your Instagram social graph while incorporating topic-based discovery.

**Priority signals:**

1. **Reply depth** — Multi-reply conversations signal high-quality threads
2. **Reshares** — The primary amplification mechanism on Threads
3. **Quote-posts** — Adding commentary to a reshare significantly boosts reach
4. **Cross-graph engagement** — Engagement from accounts outside your IG follower graph indicates broader appeal
5. **Topical relevance** — Posts matching trending topics or user interests get pushed to discovery
6. **Instagram relationship signals** — DMs, follows, and interactions on IG carry over

**Platform characteristics:**
- No hashtags initially; topics added via tag system (limited utility)
- Character limit: 500 characters per post
- Up to 10 images or one 5-minute video per post
- Fediverse integration (ActivityPub) means posts can be seen on Mastodon and other federated platforms
- No DMs (as of early 2026) — engagement is public only
- No ads (yet) — organic reach is high while the platform matures

**Current opportunity:**
- Lower competition than Twitter/X for equivalent audiences
- Instagram cross-posting drives initial distribution
- Text-forward format favors thoughtful, opinion-led content
- Reply culture is more civil and constructive than X

### Threads Post Templates

## Bluesky Deep Dive

### The Algorithm (February 2026)

Bluesky uses a **decentralized AT Protocol** with user-controlled feed algorithms. Users can choose, build, or subscribe to custom feeds.

**Priority signals:**

1. **Likes** — Basic engagement signal across all feed algorithms
2. **Reposts** — Amplification to follower network
3. **Reply chains** — Deep conversations surface in algorithmic feeds
4. **Custom feed subscriptions** — Users opt into topic feeds (e.g., "Science," "Tech News," "Marketing")
5. **Labeler signals** — Community moderators and labelers can surface or suppress content
6. **Recency** — Chronological timeline still the default for many users

**Platform characteristics:**
- Character limit: 300 characters per post
- Decentralized (AT Protocol) — users can self-host, move accounts between providers
- No advertising — purely organic distribution
- Custom feeds are the killer feature: curated algorithmic feeds anyone can create
- Starter packs help new users find communities quickly
- Growing rapidly among tech, media, journalism, and academic communities
- Domain-as-handle (e.g., yoursite.com as your handle) builds credibility

## Reddit Deep Dive

### The Algorithm (February 2026)

Reddit uses a **karma-weighted voting system** combined with recency decay. Content surfaces through subreddit feeds, the Home feed (subscribed subreddits), and the Popular/All feeds.

**Priority signals:**

1. **Upvote/downvote ratio** — Net karma determines post ranking within a subreddit
2. **Velocity of upvotes** — Fast upvotes in the first hour are critical for reaching Hot
3. **Comment count and depth** — Discussion depth is a strong engagement signal
4. **Subreddit-specific norms** — Each community has rules, culture, and moderators
5. **Account age and karma** — Newer/low-karma accounts face posting restrictions
6. **Award signals** — Gilded/awarded posts get visibility boosts

**Platform characteristics:**
- Pseudonymous by default — personal branding is secondary to content quality
- Subreddit-specific audiences with strict community rules
- Self-promotion is heavily penalized — value-first or get removed
- Long-form text posts perform well in discussion-oriented subreddits
- AMA (Ask Me Anything) format for thought leadership
- Comments often drive more value than the original post
- Reddit search is weak; Google indexes Reddit content well
- Reddit's growing influence on SEO (Google now surfaces Reddit in search results)

**Current opportunity:**
- Google's "Reddit results" feature makes subreddit content discoverable in search
- High-trust environment for authentic expertise
- Longer shelf life than social posts (top posts surface for days/weeks)
- Strong for B2B thought leadership in niche subreddits
- Community trust transfers to your brand when done right

### Reddit Content Strategies

**The Value Post:**
```
Title: [Specific, descriptive title — no clickbait]

Body:

### Reddit-Specific Rules

1. **Read the subreddit rules before posting** — Every subreddit has unique rules
2. **No overt self-promotion** — The 90/10 rule: 90% value, 10% self-reference
3. **Be transparent** — Disclose affiliations or you'll be banned
4. **Long-form wins** — Detailed, well-structured posts outperform short ones
5. **Engage in comments** — The OP (original poster) should stay active in discussion
6. **Timing matters** — Post when your target subreddit is most active (check subreddit stats)
7. **Cross-posting** — Share relevant content to related subreddits (but don't spam)

4. Hashtags in carousel slides
5. Copying Twitter energy (too casual)

### Twitter Mistakes
1. Thread too long (20+ tweets)
2. No hook in first tweet
3. Filler tweets with no value
4. Not replying to comments
5. Posting at wrong times

### Instagram Mistakes
1. Static images only (algorithm punishes)

3. No captions on video

5. Inconsistent visual style

### TikTok Mistakes
1. Slow intros (no hook for 3+ seconds)
2. Not using captions
3. Ignoring trending sounds
4. Over-produced content (authenticity wins)
5. Not responding to comments

### YouTube Mistakes
1. Clickbait that doesn't deliver
2. No hook in first 30 seconds

5. No cards/end screens

### Threads Mistakes
1. Cross-posting identical Twitter/X content (feels lazy)

5. Not leveraging Instagram cross-promotion

### Bluesky Mistakes
1. Using Twitter tone (too aggressive for Bluesky culture)
2. Ignoring custom feeds (the main discovery mechanism)

### Reddit Mistakes
1. Self-promoting without adding value (instant downvotes)
2. Ignoring subreddit rules (leads to removal/ban)
