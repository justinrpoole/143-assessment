# CLAUDE.md

## Project
- Assessment application — needs to be hosted online and available as a mobile app
- Tech decisions should favor cross-platform solutions (web + mobile from one codebase where possible)

## About Me
- I'm learning to code — explain concepts clearly when they come up
- Prefer simple, readable code over clever or compact solutions
- I learn best from examples with comments explaining the "why"

## Preferences
- Use standard best practices and conventions for whatever language is in use
- Keep code simple and well-structured — avoid over-engineering
- When suggesting fixes, briefly explain what was wrong and why the fix works
- If there are multiple approaches, mention the tradeoffs so I can learn

## Communication
- Be concise but don't skip explanations that help me understand
- If I'm doing something that could cause problems, let me know early
- Suggest better approaches when you see them, but explain why they're better
